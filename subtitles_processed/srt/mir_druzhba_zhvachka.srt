Timur really loved that car I have a grandson,Khryzon want to leave him a city without thieves.
You know...
You know, we deeply regret what happened Your son?
This is my son And mine He is ours Your son destroyed my nephew's car Now you have to buy him a new one And there was money under the seat. Ten grand I didn’t take any money He broke the car, but he didn’t take the money No,no, he didn’t take the money You heard him, he said...
The money needs to be returned How can we return it?
We don’t have that kind of money Sell the apartment.
Borrow The deadline is in a week Later, for every overdue day, I’ll cut off one of his fingers.
I can always be found at the "Caucasus" restaurant.
Wait.
Please, wait.
Sorry...
Excuse me.
Who, who are these people?
What people?
I didn’t see anyone.
How?
Don’t make fools out of us.
Wait, are you mocking us?
You saw it, just now there were people here.
They, you know, they threatened him.
They threatened my child.
They said they would cut him off every day.
We will sue you.
Please, calm down.
Your case is closed.
The Kamaz driver wrote that he crashed into a pole.
And the BMW owner has no claims.
You are free to go.
How?
Nadya, I’m sure everything will be fine.
Sasha, just don’t worry, we’re changing the toilet for the former colonel of the militia...
Is that Uncle Alyk here?
Well, hello, Zurab.
Afghan?
You shouldn’t have stopped. Start the engine.
Don’t rush.
They say your car got smashed?
How do you know?
Afghans have eyes everywhere.
Let me fix it— no questions asked.
Fix it.
But what about the money?
Ten thousand bucks disappeared from the car.
Small change, Zurab.
What about a hundred?
Not a lime.
I personally didn’t see that money.
Your word against mine?
Anyway, Zurab, I'll fix the car, but the money...
I respect your word.
But there’s no evidence.
Sorry.
As you wish.
You won’t give it—I’ll ask them.
Did you call him after all?
What, Nadya, how could I?
It’s just a lucky coincidence.
Sancho, you’re something else, nephew.
What are you even doing?
What do you need?
Me? Nothing.
I talked with the chebureks, made the deal for you with the car.
What about?
I’ll fix their car, and everything will be fine.
We don’t need your help.
Oh, really?
Yes.
Oh, what have I done! Zurab Jan, let’s rewind everything.
It’s not funny at all, understood?
Come on, smile, sis.
You already have wrinkles.
Dumbass Friends, how about coming to our place?
We’ll have some tea, eat some chicken legs.
And in the end, Ali has not been here for a long time.
How much do we owe you?
One thank you will be enough.
Thank you.
We don’t need gangster money.
We’re an honest family with a reputation.
And we won’t owe anything to people like him. How much?
A thousand bucks.
Ups.
Nadya.
I’ll pay everything.
With a receipt.
Give me the passport number and don’t forget the stamp.
You...
just unbelievable.
Where are you going?
You’ll send it by mail.
Sancho, Uncle Fyodor, hold on.
Don’t you want to visit your father?
(music playing) So, what’s up?
Mommy, this is my piggy bank.
My sunshine, of course, it’s your piggy bank.
But you see, right now we’re in a very complicated economic situation in the family.
And for this, you should thank your brother.
Here’s your brother, say thank you.
And also, my sunshine, we really need some money.
But your dad, for some reason, just doesn’t want to.
He doesn’t want to make money.
Well, because he’s very proud.
And he has his favorite thing to do.
And all the dirty, hard work is done by mommy, my sunshine! Right.
What do we have here?
Let’s see.
Aha.
Earrings, do you like the earrings?
Nice earrings.
Look, I like them too.
We’ll have to sell them.
Do you like the bracelet?
I like it too.
I also like this bracelet.
We’ll have to sell it too.
And the grandfather’s medal too, of course, we’ll have to sell it.
We’ll have to sell all of this.
My sunshine, forgive me, please, okay?
It’s okay, it’s okay, don’t cry, come here.
Nadya.
I’ll go with you to the market to work.
(song playing): The rebellious spirit, Pandora’s dream Poisoned arrows.
A fire in the chest Couldn’t Destroy the spell...
You’ll take this, and he’s under house arrest.
Mom, why just a little pancake?
Eat, bunny.
Okay, go ahead.
Have a good day.
Goodbye.
Here, take it, I don’t want it.
Dad.
Well?
Let me take the receipt myself.
You don’t need to get involved in this, San.
You shouldn’t have gotten in the car, and gone under the bridge.
Yeah.
I shouldn’t have.
Hello, Baba Manya, Baba Tonya.
(song playing): Drunken stars burned, Bullets sang, blood poured.
They died for fun, Resurrected, fought again...
Come on, come on, let’s go.
That’s it.
No more flirting with the salesgirls at the market, understood?
That’s it, hook, only for a month.
You’re kind, Oleg, I would’ve shot his balls for that.
What?
Go.
You’re so ruthless.
Alick. Alick.
Commander, damn! Some kid just got here, says he’s your nephew.
Didn’t get it.
Do you have a nephew?
I’m seeing him for the first time.
San, confirm it.
Maybe there’s something I don’t know about you?
Maybe you have a wife?
Yeah, I’m a eunuch.
I was, until I met you.
Sancho, you’re a saboteur.
Sorry, I didn’t mean to.
You’re free.
What?
Aah..Yes!
Lift up your jacket, my arms can’t bend.
Yuri...
Close the door.
Good news.
The fifth and sixth chapters of my novel are ready.
Do you remember, I gave you to read?
I don’t remember, but can you still show it to your publisher friend?
I really need the money.
It’s such a lively story.
I would thank you from the advance.
I’ll wash my hands. It’s okay, I’ll reprint it again.
Fedya, I don’t need an opus about Ivan Sergeyevich. Do you understand or not?
Ah, so you’ve read it. Well, how did you like it?
Honestly?
Yeah.
Here.
So what! He writes shitty poems himself.
Fedya, I hear everything.
This is how we do it...
Understood.
Let’s toast to the meeting.
Here, the guys from Astrakhan sent this.
Come on, come on, come on! You don’t know how to live beautifully.
Bye.
I also hate this caviar.
Donald!
Sanyok, do you have a girlfriend?
No.
It’s fixable.
Yeah, he has everything.
He stole a car for her.
Mmm, how cool.
Nobody stole a car for me.
Hey, hello.
Vitek, it suits you.
So, Vitek, do you like it when they grab your ass?
Uncle Alik, take me with you.
I have to work off this debt myself.
What?
You want to live like this?
Yes, I’m ready to do anything.
Just not criminal stuff.
Don’t worry, we’ve already killed Zurab.
So your family thinks this about me too, right?
I don’t think so.
Here’s a letter from my mom.
I’ll work it off myself.
Come on, Sancho, go home.
Chew gum, drink soda, live life to the fullest, while I’m alive, I’ll protect you.
Don’t rush to grow up.
No, I...
I want to do it myself.
I’m ready to sweep courtyards, wash cars.
Anything.
Go home, or your proper mom will yell at you.
So, kid, time to go home?
I don’t need your gum.
Come on, come on.
Fedor Ivanovich, I’m here again.
You didn’t submit the Life of Archpriest Avvakum.
I don’t have any life story.
Lost it?
Well, look for it more.
I’ll come back to you tomorrow.
Uh-huh.
If you don’t find it, it’s not a big deal.
I’ll mark it as worn out.
Fedor Ivanovich, something happened?
To me?
No. No, everything’s fine.
I just thought I was a writer.
Turns out I’m just an ordinary hack.
And my place is in the market.
What are you saying?
It can’t be that, that a person with such a love for literature as you writes badly.
You...
haven’t read it.
So let me read it.
I’ll honestly, impartially tell you how talented you are.
Yes. Let's do it.
Thank you, Tatyana.
You can just call me Tanya.
Tanya.
Sorry, what do you need?
Maybe I can do something?
I want to make up for my screw-up in front of Uncle Alik.
You need to, you make up for it.
Please, I'll do anything.
Listen, do you see the Shishik parked there?
What?
Over your shoulder.
Gas 66.
There are boxes of canned food, you need to unload it.
We need an empty truck by evening, urgently.
Alright, I'll do it.
Well, why are you just staring, the Gas is over there.
Thanks.
No problem.
Fyodor Ivanovich.
Fyodor Ivanovich.
Yes.
Yes, I'm here.
Are you the new Pikul?
Are you Marques?
I meant to say, are you the new Marques?
Come on.
Marques.
Now I...
Now, my favorite part.
If love could be measured with a thermometer, their apartment would have long been covered with a thin silver shawl of frost.
You... You feel loneliness so accurately. You...
You... You feel loneliness so well.
I can't, I'm gonna cry.
Oh no, don't cry, don't cry.
Don't cry, I mean...
You don't need to cry, and I don't want you to cry either.
Please, don't cry.
Fyodor Ivanovich, may I kiss you?
Not as a man, as a genius.
Sure.
Why not?
On the cheek, on the cheek, is that okay?
Yes, just...
don't call me a genius.
I'm just an ordinary writer.
Fyodor Ivanovich, your novel...
The world must see it.
Really?
No, the front struts are bent, consider it done for.
It'd be easier to get a new one from Germany.
And ten thousand bucks?
Let the suckers take the bait.
Well, by their standards, it's a screw-up.
They can claim it.
Let them try.
If they come after me, well'll fuck them like we did a year ago.
And what if they go after my guys?
I'll send a couple of fighters with RPGs, and that's it.
The Zurabs will go back to the mountains with their pockets full.
No, we don't need that war right now.
War, commander, never ends.
Once we bend, they'll keep fucking us for life.
That's it, Uncle Alik, I've done everything.
I unloaded the truck.
I don't get it.
Which truck?
And where?
I took it to the warehouse.
Good job! Bring it back.
How come?
Sancho, we just loaded it to take to the nursing home.
Hold on! Where are you going, stop. I'll get you home Hey, who's gonna load the food back?
Yeah, damn belt buckle.
Alik, let's go to three wins.
Commander.
Just don't pinch my nipples.
(music plays) Thanks, Uncle Alik.
Sancho!
Turbulent times are starting.
Here, you'll be defending the family.
Seriously?
No robbing stalls, don't dig your nose with a gun.
(male voice): So, I tell him: "Hey, you got the wrong guy?" Well, our guys showed up then. (female laugh) Oh, Fedya's here.
Here, husband.
Fedya, meet Vitalik.
Hello.
Nadyukha says you're going in for Raika tomorrow?
Rest in peace.
By the way, I congratulate you on your anniversary.
You really got lucky with your wife.
Nadyukha, well, I’m off.
I won’t make it for the night. Well, go ahead.
Well, go, husband.
Your cardigan is a bomb.
Exactly like this, they buried Raika.
Nadyukha, be careful with your things.
See you tomorrow.
Nadyu. What’s up?
Who's this character? This is our boss.
Well, really, you'll get used to it.
Mom, Dad.
I didn’t give you the gift yesterday.
Yeah. This is for you.
Thank you.
Sorry, Mom.
Okay.
Let's go have some tea.
Hi. Hi.
Looks nice, huh? Yeah.
Well, sit down, what are you standing for?
Listen, sorry I left you. It's just...
If Dad had found out, he would have torn my legs off.
It’s okay, I would’ve left you too if I hadn’t lost consciousness.
Want some beer? But I’ve never drunk.
Me neither, so what?
Huh?
It probably tastes good.
Yeah.
Can I ask you something? Yeah.
Yesterday, when I was sunbathing, did you stare at me for a long time?
No, we didn’t stare.
Yeah.
Thank you. You're welcome.
Oh, what’s this? You’re drinking without us, huh?
Ugh, what kind of crap is this?
Expired or something? How does my dad even drink this, here.
Anyway, you won’t believe it, we were saving a dead cat yesterday. And then we were with this idiot on the go on the train - wow!
What about you guys? What do you have?
The car was stolen!
(music plays)
