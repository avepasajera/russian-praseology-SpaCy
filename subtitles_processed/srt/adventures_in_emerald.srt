Can I use the mileage?
Mileage?
Possibly to America but you are 20,000 miles short.
Then, how far can I go with it?
Pardon?
Excuse me for a minute.
Hello. This is PARK Man-Soo.
When can I expect the money you borrowed from me?
sorry?
I didn't borrow any money.
Aren't you the PARK Man-Soo who directed the City of Scream?
Yes, I am the director PARK Man-Soo.
You borrowed 200,000 dollar to make that movie.
But I am a director.
Directors are the ones who make movies?
We have business to discuss.
Well, I am at the Inchon airport about the board the plane.
Sure, Sure. Look across the street.
Eh?
There seems to be a misunderstanding.
I have nothing to do with the financial matters of the movie.
Isn 't it illegal to just kidnap someone like this?
We don't know the detail.
We bring you to the boss when he wants and send you away when he's done with you Send me away? Where?
Where you wanna go?
Patagonia.
Where?
It means big foot.
Bit foot.
to the end of the world.
On the other side of the globe...
it is said to be a great place.
Big foot?
You should be specific like Underground, in the sea, in the mountain...
then we can take care of it.
Where?
Under the ground, or in the sea or mountain.
I really have no financial responsibility about.
Some big mouth you got, son of a bitch!
I would like to send him away.
I could do no such thing, Sir.
He is my dad.
That old man.
He is from high land of Gaema in Hamgyoungdo.
He's left home missing for the tenth time.
You know such condition for old people.
Al... Almond...Al Pacino...
Alzheimer?
Whatever.
Anyway, he's a little off.
It's about time to go.
It's embarrassing since it's a domestic matter.
So I would like to send him away.
Sir, I understand the difficulties dealing with sick old man.
But you cannot possibly think of such horrible thing.
You are a bit slow for a movie director, eh?
To Gaema plateau.
I would like to send him there.
Anything's possible in a movie.
Find a similar sight and put up a sign that says Gaema plateau.
One picture there would make him happy.
Souvenir, you know.
Old people pass time looking at photos.
You're not lying?
'Be straight!' If you don't want to, never mind.
What a handsome picture.
Uh... my... my passport.
Don't worry.
Just keeping it for you.
I'll need that.
Go!
Do you have a new project offered yet?
How about a thriller this time rather than erotic picture?
Corpses buried in the mountain...
cut in pieces.
Floating pieces of flesh on the ocean.
With a mysterious woman.
Scary, isn't it?
Hey, what are you doing snatching the ball from children?
What kind of grown up are you?
What?
Let's go kids.
I must've waken you up. Sorry.
What bring you here?
We're going to see grandpa Bae.
But we're not ready yet.
Get ready on the way.
PARK Soo-dong Grandpa Pear! How are you?
Where you going again?
Where do you want me to take you?
- Come on, kid! Let's go.
- What's going on with you?
- What's going on with you?
- Let's go. Move your ass.
Well, sir, where you going?
Hold on.
- Sir!
- Let's go.
- Move!You lazy boy. Hurry up.
- Sir.
- Let's go. Just walk.
- But where are you going to?
Sir.
- Hey! You've got to tell me where?
- Let's go. Let's go!
- Look!
- Let's go!
Sir!
Sir!
Dad, you drunk again? Huh?
Think of Mom.
What are you here for?
- you half wit, sly rat.
- Sir, what's wrong?
You rat I don't want that money!
Hey!
Go inside, or I'll hit you.
Go inside!
He's like that sometimes.
But it's a good sign that he thinks you are his son.
No way.
I look nothing like him.
At least one of rat, half wit, or snitch.
Nothing difficult really, if you think about it.
By the way, you were rude to speak to him that way.
Well, he listens to me, at least.
How can I go with him when he hates his son so much.
No father hates his son, just can't bear him to be disgraceful.
Can I ask you something?
Shoot.
The doorplate says that his name is PARK, why do you call him Granpa Pear?
Our director has a sharp sense.
The story goes that when he first showed signs of Alzheimer we took him to the hospital.
Sir. Which one of these is an apple?
Can you pick up an apple?
apple!
So we called him Grandpa Pear since.
He is getting much worse recently.
You've been lying all along.
Hey! Not you too.
Despite all, you don't owe them money and tricking people isn't filmmaker's job.
Sit down. Continue.
So we're filming?
No, we go on as if making a movie.
What if we get caught?
I know little of it so I'll leave that up to you.
Wait!
You see, making a movie requires much preparation and a lot of people have to come together.
Do you know Al Pacino?
He's an actor who played a blind man in the Scent of Women. A blind man.
There is a scene where he falls while dancing.
When he was about to fall, he finds a big nail sticking out on the ground.
Well, he is supposed to be blind.
So he fell on the nail.
Oh, shit! So? He got pricked?
I'd love to meet this guy.
- Who?
- That Al... Al...
the blind buy with a nail stuck in the eye.
What I am trying to say is that it is not easy to trick people.
Hold on, let me take care of some business then tell me the rest.
Ah, that scum bag!
That piece of shit!
Spare me. Ouch! Agh!
What's the boss' moto? Be straight!
Date and time is quite plain and clear.
He hates people who can't keep their time.
- you promised to pay back today - Please don't kill me!
and I promised I will send you away if you don't.
At least I'll keep my word.
Close it!
Hey! Hey!
Mail it.
When you fight or scare people, don't look in their eyes.
Eyes make you weak.
I don't like fighting at all.
Neither do I.
We have something in common.
Ah, I told Grandpa Pear that he got permission to go to North Korea in a weak.
That old man sure wants to go home.
What? In a week?
- Is it a problem?
- No... well, it's kind of...
Kind of? Problem or no problem?
It's not a problem but I could surely use more time to get things in order...
Be straight! Problem or no problem?
So, it is not a problem but realistically there are much to be done ahead...
Make up your mind.
I am not smart enough for such complications.
Just tell me if it is a problem or no problem. What is it?
No problem!
Fine. Then it's a deal.
Keep your promise if you don't want to be sent away.
I will.
Hello.
True Hamheung noodle is only served in North Korea.
If it is made with the Hangang river water, it is Hangang noodle not Hamheung noodle.
We guarantee the best quality service to Grandpa PARK Soo-dong including a nice female companion.
Can you speak North Korean?
Try North Korean dialect.
I couldn't fake it.
I lived only a short life to summarize in a few words.
Overcoming the 50 years of separation since independence...
We didn't even pay them the guarantee for the last movie.
I brought them with promise of casting for the next movie.
Go ahead. Let's see what you got.
Have you had a big breakfast?
You will need a full stomach to walk around the home town.
I will make it a mission to lead you...
She is Korean-Chinese from the border.
Sounds just right. Try singing?
In the sky...
- how did I do?
- Yeah, OK.
What's with that guy?
Hey, you!
You are not allowed in here.
You are a prop.
Outside! Now!
Uhh... LEE Sung-Chul of Na-tional secu-rity, at your service.
You must follow my instruc...tions to en...sure a safe trip.
Thank you.
There is something I must ask you.
What?
I need a car but the budget can't cover it.
What kind of car?
All of them drive Benz.
We cannot drive South Korean car.
- how many?
- Just one will do.
- Consider it done.
- Alright.
Why can't I just say 'let's go' No way. He will get suspicious.
Congratulation/ Mr. PARK Soo-Dong's visiting to hometown in North Korea.
Aren't you the PARK's son?
Ah yeah, how are you?
Time changed you so. I can't recognize you at all.
Wow, completely different person.
- Is dad inside?
- He's gone.
- Gone where?
- Maybe yesterday?
Maybe today.
He said he's going to his hometown.
Where? Hometown, where?
Dad!
Hey!
We've met once before, remember?
We should get to your hometown.
I'm not going.
If you don't go, I'm a dead meat.
No! I'm not going.
Ey! You think you will better off without me?
Are you out of your mind?
No way I'm taking you.
I'm going with you.
I'm the one who has been putting food in your mouth.
Ok. I won't go.
Woman, you've finally gone mad.
You are going there to see Gab-bun.
You think I don't know that?
Let go.
I said I'm not going.
I am not going.
I am not going.
- We have to go now.
- I'm not going. No.
Are you OK?
Oh, you were here.
Take this with you. I want you to give these photos to my kids there.
I don't know if we'll have such time for...
I miss them so much.
No. I won't go!
- His head popped!
- Dad. Dad!
- Please, don't forget. I really miss them.
- I'll make sure they get it, of course.
Dad! Dad! Wait up!
Bon voyage!
What?
I can't connect with Sung-Chul.
What am I gonna do with Benz?
Never mind. We'll take any car.
I'm hanging up.
Man-Soo, what's wrong with me?
Why have you done wrong?
Why let them harass you like this?
It's not my fault that the movie flopped.
Do I get rich if the movie sells?
My dream has nothing to do with gangster's father realizing his dream.
Why can't I be left alone?
Here we are.
Let's get off now.
- Hand me your bag.
- Don't touch it.
Just over that line, is North Korea.
Are you Ok sir?
No! Call the Ambulence!
No. I am fine.
I have to go. Go over.
Are you parents alive, then?
Well, that's...
Dead? Alright.
Come with me then.
Shoot, I was told never to open my mouth.
We must go.
Are you Ok sir?
Wellcome, comrade PARK Soo-Dong.
Welcome home!
Comrade Grandpa!
Welcome!
The car isn't here yet.
What?
We can go now.
Comrade Grandpa!
I hope you had a big breakfast.
You'll need the full stomach for the busy day ahead.
Big day, it is.
I will accompany you to your hometown so not to worry.
Please get in the car, now.
Please get in the car.
Let's move.
Comrade driver, he's new in the job.
Please understand, comrade grandpa.
We haven't got all day.
Comrade, let's get to the highway.
Hurry.
Shit!
Finally, Grandpa KIM Soo-dong, no, PARK Soo-dong comes back to his hometown in 50 years!
20 million people of Chosun Republic!
Let's welcome him!
Hey, diver.
You'd better ask me, dad.
Why did you come after me?
I'm your son.
Why did you tag along, when you should be studying?
So I am still your son, dad?
Comrade Grandpa.
You can ask me whatever you want.
Take me to this place.
There are many villages like this.
t looks like where I grew up.
What's your name, miss?
ou shouldn't call her miss, dad.
Oh, no never mind, Comrade Grandpa.
My name is YEON Hong-Mae.
Hong-Mae. Yes. Hong-Mae, can you take me there?
No. We have other place to go.
Take me there.
You said you will take me home.
Comrade Grandpa, don't worry.
What do you mean, don't worry?
I am sorry.
Driver, take me there, would you?
Yes. Sure.
What do you mean, sure?
That will cost a fortune.
Fuck! We just say we go!
They say we can go.
Stupid moron.
- I'll see about that.
- No!
013503, 013503, black Benz vehicle information please.
I'll have to see that.
No, not you!
Comrade Grandpa, why don't you let him see the picture.
Let me take a look.
Here. We have to get there.
They don't know where it is.
We have a tour planned out already.
You, ingrate! Give me back the watch you stole!
Watch?
3503, Black Benz, pull over.
Stop the car!
Why don't we pull over?
3503 Pull over to the side. Now!
Stop the car.
They will stop following at some point.
- Comrade Grandpa, are you OK?
- Okay.
You, good for nothing, you hit somebody? What did you do?
Just beg for forgiveness.
Tell them you are sorry.
But, I didn't do anything wrong.
Stop the car.
Let's stop the car.
Stop the car now!
I said stop!!
Have you gone deaf?
Pull over to the side!
Who the hell are you?
Good day, officer.
I can explain everything.
Just calm down.
Pathetic piece of crap, I knew it.
Not a day goes by without trouble.
Hopeless!
This wouldn't stop us from going to the village?
Not at all. You have nothing to worry.
You people are looking for trouble.
There are laws and principles.
Who will keep the order of our nation if all the displaced people pull off such thing?
Don't you see the news?
There are innumerable applicants waiting to go to North Korea.
Do they respect the law out of stupidity?
Why is this guy so quiet?
He doesn't talk much.
Listen.
If all the passers-by pick the flowers on the street, there will be none left.
Huh?
You look old enough to have such common sense.
How old are you?
And that!
Display of such flag is against the law.
Which country do you belong to?
3503 Stolen vehicle! Stolen!
- you are under arrest.
- you stole this car?
- You Fucker!
- Oh, my, are you nuts?
What are you doing!
I am 34 years old.
What's your business in that?
Stop it!
Are you nuts?
Officer! open your eyes!
In the middle of the freezing cold winter, what flower!
You son of a bitch!
Does this look like a flower to you?
Are you crazy?
Officer are you OK?
Officer!
Officer!
You son of a bitch!
You're really going mad, know.
Let me go.
Get out of my way!
Are you OK?
Get in the car. In the car!
What flower?
Hurry up.
Let's get out of here.
Damn it!
Start the car!
How can you bring a stolen car?
I told you I borrowed it.
What is going on?
Just tell them you are sorry.
You good for nothing!
34 years means you were born with sign of rat.
Why?
I am 35, Pig.
So?
Just telling you.
Oh no. what are we going to do?
- Grandpa has wet His pants...
- I'm ok. It's fine.
- Grandpa!Are you OK?
- I'm ok.
First? It's me.
Dad, get out of the car.
Let's get you changed.
I'm ok.
Give me your bag.
No way I step out of the car.
You try to get rid of me?
- Give me the bag.
- Not a chance.
Let him be.
I think you're Ok.
Who do you think you are?
What are you trying to pull here?
This kind of village might be all over where you come from, but to recreate that here cost a fortune.
I am sorry.
I don't need an uncontrollable mouth like you. Go home.
Mr. Director, we should still get him to change his pants.
He must be cold in those wet pants.
Let's get him changed first...
I must ask you a favor.
Shoot!
It is rather to clarify the situation.
This trip strictly has to follow my instruction.
I am the one who takes responsibility when something goes wrong.
So you mean, you are the boss.
No, it's not about being a boss.
I'm talking about the responsibility.
So you are not the boss?
It is not the issue of who is the boss.
It seems like you are the boss.
I'm gonna crazy!
What's wrong with this guy!
Is that the only way to explain the world to you?
There are more things in the world.
So you want to be the boss, the point is.
Fine! I am the boss and you are just along for a ride.
But my life depends on this.
Life? Right!
That's cool, boss.
I'm going mad.
Hey, Lieutenant, feeling comfy?
Get up!
I'll get them car thieves.
Where? Stop right there.
Yes, I missed this taste.
Hanheung noodle is original here.
If you make it with Han Gang river water, it'd only be Hang Gang noodle.
Don't you agree, Comrade Grandpa?
Where are you from?
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
Excuse me, do you have anything to drink?
Dad, no. No alcohol.
Why not. A drink to go along with the food he missed so much.
You little rat. She says it's OK.
What's it to you?
Wow, nice atmosphere. Huh?
Redecorated the place?
If you were to make a movie, you first should've gotten permission.
Why did you have to come to our town to turn it into North Korea?
People in this village died to protect their home during Skull battle, Eagle peak battle, and what else?
- What?
- Haengju battle.
Yeah, did you hear that?
What is this?
This is not our food.
Where is ostrich meat?
That's what we are famous for.
Yeah, the ostrich.
Ostrich!
Oy! You fatzo!
You laughing at me? Huh?
Ouch! You're gonna hit me?
There seems to be a misunderstanding.
Who is the director? I need to be compensated for emotional distress.
Why don't you tell me.
This is not your place to get involved.
Which one of you is the director?
Don't you know that we are working for unification of the country.
You are too small beat up.
What is the guy?
Guys, sit down. Don't run.
You should take responsibility of your action.
Wow, you must be an actress, sugar!
Stupid jerk, who said you can call me like that.
Didn't your mother teach you how to behave?
Marines aren't supposed to mess with women.
- Shut your face!
- Oh my.
You should consider yourselves lucky.
My parents died in Manchuria fighting the Japanese.
What kind of life is that?
Come and have a drink with me.
- Wow, the actress is buying.
- Good!
Here, give us five bottles of Soju and squid.
Soju? What for?
Goryangju 20 bottles please.
Bottoms up!
Drink.
Hey, Ostrich!
Aren't you sleeping, yet?
Are you awake?
How do you feel?
I displayed quite an embarrassing scene tonight, I guess.
Not at all.
Look, Grandpa, look.
There is no more programs for tonight.
Let me watch it.
Today's program is over.
You, son of a bitch!
Do you have something to tell me?
I wanted to say thank you.
- Don't mention it.
- Director PARK.
- What?
- Director PARK.
You should go see Grandpa Pear in his room.
- What?
- you should go see in His room.
I just want to catch up with the news of my home town.
Holy shit.
Comrade Grandpa insists on watching TV.
There is no stopping him.
Boss.
- Start setting up.
- Yeah. Huh?
Shooting, shooting. Get up!
Ugh... what shooting?
Get ready in two minute.
Wake up, What's this?
You are going to help me.
Out of the way.
You're blocking the TV.
Yes. Dad. It's working now.
Today, Grandpa PARK Soo-Dong arrived through Panmunjeom to visit his home town.
People who witnessed this historical moment were overcome by tears of joy.
This is how one of them expressed her welcome.
I just wish you take some good photos when you go.
- And enjoy your Hanheung noodle.
- Thank you. Thank you.That was delicious...
Welcome. Let me introduce you the famous Ostriches of North Korea.
This one's Southy and that's Northy.
I can sing.
I can fly to the sky.
I am stronger than you.
I am not really an ostrich but a crane.
- If you are a crane, I am a dragon.
- I am God.
I am the red devil.
How come you are the red devil.
This is what their fight had come to.
quack Let's not fight.
Finally, we will finish today's program with a visual message from South Korea.
We wish you a pleasant dream.
I miss you sister.
Your name is PARK Ok-Rye and I am PARK Ok-Soon.
I've missed you so much my one and only sister.
You must not die until the day we meet and hold hands.
I wait for our reunion day and night.
Live long so we can meet. I miss you.
That's our village on TV.
That's where we are.
Hah, our town's on TV.
- Yes, boss.
- Everything's going well?
Everything is going well.
Good work.
What's up?
But I am afraid we'll need more money though.
- What money?
- We need to build a little village.
Did you screw up?
Movies aren't made easy.
We have to put our lives on the line.
Who's dead?
No, no one got killed.
- I mean, we put our lives to complete...
- you think you are a movie director?
Do your job and keep your eyes on the rat next to you.
Sure thing boss.
- Be straight!
- I understand.
It isn't easy to trick him.
My father never held my hand.
I only feared him and wished him dead.
He passed away a few years ago.
I must be getting punished right now.
Have you ever held your father's hand?
I'm an orphan.
No one is here yet?
Chop chop!
hurry up you have to memorize this lines.
- Nothing for me?
- You're a prop.
I don't have a line.
You cannot handle it.
First, how is it going?
We are ready as ever be. Perfect.
You've been doing a wonderful job.
Let's hold out one more day.
- Fighting!
- Fighting.
- Photographer?
- Yeah.
Not here yet?
What was perfect then?
What kind of nude photography shoot is in such early hour?
hello Who's in charge?
A terrible thing happened.
- Why?
- Comrade Grandpa has disappeared.
What?
He's not there?
- have you seen him?
- No.
- have you seen him?
- No.
Grandpa?
Some strange old man was looking for some Gamma park or something.
Which way did he go?
I told him I don't know where that is.
Some clever guy.
Don't go anywhere.
Hey!
Where are you going, dad?
You shouldn't wander around alone.
Who are you?
Half wit, sly rat, stupid moron son.
I've come to take you to your home town.
Liar! You? My son?
Don't you think I'd recognize my own son?
Come clean.
You sold that watch, didn't you?
Comrade Grandpa, Comrade Grandpa.
Take me home.
They won't let me see my home town.
Let's go. We're almost there.
Just over that hill.

You said somewhere's gotta be like that.
I'm gonna crazy.
I told you movie is not that easy.
You can't just cut in and make decisions.
I cannot carry out my job like that.
Your job is to take him to his home town.
You should've said this from the beginning.
He says this is not it.
He'll listen to you.
You can take care of it.
I don't know anymore.
- I can't - Why can't you, now?
We go if he wants to go.
You're not making sense.
Fuck.
He is the father of our boss.
Do whatever you want.
I don't know now.
You! Why you have so much to say about everything?
Watch it.
You never done a movie?
Who's your agent?
A movie is made only when actors follow the director's order You must trust him.

- Why don't you hit again?
- Come here!
- Hit me!
- What are you, bitch!
They want to go home. They say they will leave unless they get paid now.
- I said I'll pay them.
- We don't have the money.
We spent all of it to build the sets.
Hey!
Keep working, I'll get the money Shut your face, you think you are the director?
You are crazy acting like you are in charge.
Stop please.
I'm begging you.
I am sorry.
This kid doesn't know how the world works.
He always uses trick and live loosely in South Korea.
- You got it wrong. Please!
- You rat!
Don't come if you don't want to.
This half wit, sly rat, moron.
We'll go without him.
Yes. Let's go.
Stupid son of a bitch, still hasn't come to your sense?
- You don't know anything!
- Fuck. I can't take this anymore.
Here we are, everyone, this is Gaema Plateau.
We came here.
There seems to be a film shoot.
You can stay for a while and take pictures.
What the hell is that?

This isn't your playground.
Son of bitch!
Son of bitch!

- to get money.
Your boss said no.
Even if we get the money how can we find a studio?
That man.
Who?
Al... with a nail in the eye.
Al Pacino?
What does he do nowadays?
You can't just barge in demanding money, you know?
He doesn't pay even when we ask him.
He's certainly not going to pay when we do nothing.
He's always got cash.
can I ask you something?
What?
Grandpa Pear keeps talking about the watch.
What is it?
A watch?
Ah that watch.
The story goes.
He learned to fix watches...
from a man with a wen.
While he was at it...
he also fell in love with his daughter Gab-Bun.
You half wit, sly rat, moron.
Grandpa Pear soon became skillful and traveled around the country fixing clocks.
Unfortunately...
the war broken when he was working in Seoul.
That watch given by the dying teacher is the only thing that connected him to his home.
He couldn't go back.
Since then, he married in South Korea and had a son.
But he couldn't adapt to his new life.
It was't a good influence to a kid.
He probably wore his father's watch to the beach as a teenager and lost it.
He still takes us to the beach every year and makes us look for the watch.
What is it?
What's going on?
How have you been, KIM?
What we have here?
Seong-Chul?
What brings you here in such late hour.
Pay me back some money.
- What money?
- Money you borrowed.
It is not due till a month later, you crazy son of a bitch.
Still, give me the money.
This is not what we agreed.
Agreement?
You told me to be straight and punctual.
Sorry I am late, boss.

I'll explain it to the boss later, OK?
What agreement?
Nobody agreed for you to be born?
- Stupid motherfucker!
- You son of bitch!

You said you have money to collect.
This is stealing not collecting.
You've got a big mouth.
I don't want to get shot.
They are following us.

They are getting on my nerves.

He is coming closer, towards us.
You want a face to face?
Brace yourselves, here I come.

Are you nuts?
Risking your life for money?
If you are willing to put your life to it, - you always win.
