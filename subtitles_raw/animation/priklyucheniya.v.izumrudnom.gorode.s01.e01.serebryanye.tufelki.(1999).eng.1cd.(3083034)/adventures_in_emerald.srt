1
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,377
Can I use the mileage?

2
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,974
Mileage?

3
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:59,181
Possibly to America but you are
20,000 miles short.

4
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:03,326
Then, how far can I go with it?

5
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,624
Pardon?

6
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,825
Excuse me for a minute.

7
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,229
Hello. This is PARK Man-Soo.

8
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,738
<i>When can I expect the money
you borrowed from me?</i>

9
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,035
sorry?

10
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,938
I didn't borrow any money.

11
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,445
<i>Aren't you the PARK Man-Soo
who directed the City of Scream?</i>

12
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:22,947
Yes, I am the director PARK Man-Soo.

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:28,453
<i>You borrowed 200,000 dollar
to make that movie.</i>

14
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,455
But I am a director.

15
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,254
<i>Directors are the ones who make movies?
We have business to discuss.</i>

16
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:40,661
Well, I am at the Inchon airport

17
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,361
about the board the plane.

18
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,869
<i>Sure, Sure. Look across the street.</i>

19
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,165
Eh?

20
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,381
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

21
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,014
I have nothing to do with
the financial matters of the movie.

22
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,829
Isn 't it illegal
to just kidnap someone like this?

23
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,828
We don't know the detail.

24
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,629
We bring you to
the boss when he wants

25
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,136
and send you away
when he's done with you

26
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,735
Send me away? Where?

27
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,242
Where you wanna go?

28
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,945
Patagonia.

29
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,151
Where?

30
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,260
It means big foot.

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,355
Bit foot.

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,765
to the end of the world.

33
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,466
On the other side of the globe...

34
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,670
it is said to be a great place.

35
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,611
Big foot?

36
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:09,211
You should be specific like Underground,
in the sea, in the mountain...

37
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,313
then we can take care of it.

38
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,815
Where?

39
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:20,230
Under the ground,
or in the sea or mountain.

40
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,733
I really have no financial
responsibility about.

41
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,429
Some big mouth you got,
son of a bitch!

42
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,342
I would like to send him away.

43
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,837
I could do no such thing, Sir.

44
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,947
He is my dad.

45
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,254
That old man.

46
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:48,957
He is from high land
of Gaema in Hamgyoungdo.

47
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:54,058
He's left home missing
for the tenth time.

48
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,061
You know such condition for
old people.

49
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:06,407
Al... Almond...Al Pacino...

50
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,513
Alzheimer?

51
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,715
Whatever.

52
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,026
Anyway, he's a little off.

53
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,529
It's about time to go.

54
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:32,032
It's embarrassing since
it's a domestic matter.

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,937
So I would like to send him away.

56
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:45,347
Sir, I understand the difficulties
dealing with sick old man.

57
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:47,844
But you cannot possibly

58
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,454
think of such horrible thing.

59
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:59,656
You are a bit slow
for a movie director, eh?

60
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,501
To Gaema plateau.
I would like to send him there.

61
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:09,807
Anything's possible in a movie.

62
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,610
Find a similar sight and put up a sign
that says Gaema plateau.

63
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,208
One picture there would make
him happy.

64
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,311
Souvenir, you know.

65
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:25,914
Old people pass time
looking at photos.

66
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,224
You're not lying?

67
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,025
<i>'Be straight!'</i>

68
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,132
If you don't want to, never mind.

69
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,137
What a handsome picture.

70
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,746
Uh... my... my passport.

71
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,545
Don't worry.

72
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,450
Just keeping it for you.

73
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,653
I'll need that.

74
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,951
Go!

75
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,897
Do you have a new project
offered yet?

76
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:19,408
How about a thriller this time
rather than erotic picture?

77
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:23,712
Corpses buried in the mountain...
cut in pieces.

78
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,115
Floating pieces of flesh
on the ocean.

79
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,713
With a mysterious woman.

80
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,120
Scary, isn't it?

81
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:02,079
Hey, what are you doing snatching
the ball from children?

82
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,382
What kind of grown up are you?

83
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,786
What?

84
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,590
Let's go kids.

85
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,096
I must've waken you up. Sorry.

86
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,101
What bring you here?

87
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,694
We're going to see grandpa Bae.

88
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,906
But we're not ready yet.

89
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,807
Get ready on the way.

90
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,170
<i>PARK Soo-dong</i>

91
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,275
Grandpa Pear! How are you?

92
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,385
Where you going again?

93
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,785
Where do you want me to take you?

94
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:31,299
- Come on, kid! Let's go.
- What's going on with you?

95
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,004
- What's going on with you?
- Let's go. Move your ass.

96
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:37,913
Well, sir, where you going?
Hold on.

97
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,010
- Sir!
- Let's go.

98
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,424
- Move!You lazy boy. Hurry up.
- Sir.

99
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,330
- Let's go. Just walk.
- But where are you going to?

100
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,177
Sir.

101
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:15,380
- Hey! You've got to tell me where?
- Let's go. Let's go!

102
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,479
- Look!
- Let's go!

103
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,887
Sir!

104
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,324
Sir!

105
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,639
Dad, you drunk again? Huh?

106
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,250
Think of Mom.

107
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,755
What are you here for?

108
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:28,259
- you half wit, sly rat.
- Sir, what's wrong?

109
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,957
You rat
I don't want that money!

110
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,362
Hey!

111
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,259
Go inside, or I'll hit you.

112
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,574
Go inside!

113
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,583
He's like that sometimes.

114
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,988
But it's a good sign that

115
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,028
he thinks you are his son.

116
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,427
No way.

117
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,931
I look nothing like him.

118
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,524
At least one of rat,

119
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,437
half wit,

120
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,438
or snitch.

121
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,235
Nothing difficult really,

122
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,644
if you think about it.

123
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,149
By the way, you were rude
to speak to him that way.

124
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,657
Well, he listens to me, at least.

125
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,356
How can I go with him
when he hates his son so much.

126
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,263
No father hates his son,
just can't bear him to be disgraceful.

127
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,271
Can I ask you something?

128
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,177
Shoot.

129
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:04,111
The doorplate says that his name is PARK,
why do you call him Granpa Pear?

130
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,122
Our director has a sharp sense.

131
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,026
The story goes that when

132
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:20,636
he first showed signs of Alzheimer
we took him to the hospital.

133
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,834
Sir. Which one of these is an apple?

134
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,843
Can you pick up an apple?

135
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,945
apple!

136
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:46,659
So we called him Grandpa Pear since.

137
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,165
He is getting much worse recently.

138
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,870
You've been lying all along.

139
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,567
Hey! Not you too.

140
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,973
Despite all,
you don't owe them money and

141
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,104
tricking people isn't filmmaker's job.

142
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,921
Sit down. Continue.

143
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:25,829
So we're filming?

144
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:33,638
No, we go on as if making a movie.

145
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:36,544
What if we get caught?

146
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:51,953
I know little of it
so I'll leave that up to you.

147
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,505
Wait!

148
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,215
You see, making a movie requires

149
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:19,917
much preparation and a lot of people

150
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,620
have to come together.

151
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,234
Do you know Al Pacino?

152
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,739
He's an actor who played a blind man

153
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,742
in the Scent of Women. A blind man.

154
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,644
There is a scene
where he falls while dancing.

155
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,239
When he was about to fall, he finds

156
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,946
a big nail sticking out on the ground.

157
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,648
Well, he is supposed to be blind.

158
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:57,559
So he fell on the nail.

159
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:04,902
Oh, shit! So? He got pricked?

160
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,402
I'd love to meet this guy.

161
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,707
- Who?
- That Al... Al...

162
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:18,806
the blind buy with a nail stuck
in the eye.

163
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,117
What I am trying to say is
that it is not easy to trick people.

164
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,716
Hold on, let me take care of some business
then tell me the rest.

165
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,629
Ah, that scum bag!
That piece of shit!

166
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,286
Spare me. Ouch! Agh!

167
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:06,397
What's the boss' moto? Be straight!

168
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,695
Date and time is quite plain and clear.

169
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,394
He hates people
who can't keep their time.

170
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:15,496
- you promised to pay back today
- Please don't kill me!

171
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,906
and I promised I will send you away
if you don't.

172
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,912
At least I'll keep my word.

173
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,208
Close it!

174
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:30,013
Hey! Hey!

175
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,931
Mail it.

176
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:54,840
When you fight or scare people,
don't look in their eyes.

177
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:57,142
Eyes make you weak.

178
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,009
I don't like fighting at all.

179
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,285
Neither do I.

180
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:07,288
We have something in common.
Ah, I told Grandpa Pear that he got permission

181
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,887
to go to North Korea in a weak.
That old man sure wants to go home.

182
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:17,097
What? In a week?

183
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:22,799
- Is it a problem?
- No... well, it's kind of...

184
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:29,304
Kind of? Problem or no problem?

185
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:35,320
It's not a problem but I could surely use
more time to get things in order...

186
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,117
Be straight! Problem or no problem?

187
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,114
So,

188
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,823
it is not a problem but realistically
there are much to be done ahead...

189
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,424
Make up your mind.
I am not smart enough for such complications.

190
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:55,135
Just tell me if it is a problem
or no problem. What is it?

191
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,740
No problem!

192
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,674
Fine. Then it's a deal.

193
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,786
Keep your promise
if you don't want to be sent away.

194
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,583
I will.

195
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,395
Hello.

196
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,799
True Hamheung noodle is only served
in North Korea.

197
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,495
If it is made with the Hangang river water,
it is Hangang noodle not Hamheung noodle.

198
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,506
We guarantee the best quality service to
Grandpa PARK Soo-dong

199
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,100
including a nice female companion.

200
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:34,804
Can you speak North Korean?

201
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,403
Try North Korean dialect.

202
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,415
I couldn't fake it.

203
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:47,622
I lived only a short life
to summarize in a few words.

204
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:53,722
Overcoming the 50 years of separation
since independence...

205
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,629
We didn't even pay them the guarantee
for the last movie.

206
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,261
I brought them with promise of casting
for the next movie.

207
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,573
Go ahead. Let's see what you got.

208
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,887
Have you had a big breakfast?

209
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,689
You will need a full stomach to walk
around the home town.

210
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:26,286
I will make it
a mission to lead you...

211
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,790
She is Korean-Chinese from the border.

212
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:31,796
Sounds just right. Try singing?

213
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:37,501
<i>In the sky...</i>

214
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,009
- how did I do?
- Yeah, OK.

215
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,111
What's with that guy?

216
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:48,814
Hey, you!

217
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:53,316
You are not allowed in here.
You are a prop.

218
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:54,722
Outside! Now!

219
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:23,048
Uhh... LEE Sung-Chul
of Na-tional secu-rity,

220
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:30,061
at your service.

221
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:41,462
You must follow my instruc...tions
to en...sure a safe trip.

222
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,768
Thank you.

223
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,782
There is something I must ask you.

224
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,982
What?

225
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,027
I need a car but
the budget can't cover it.

226
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,222
What kind of car?

227
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,425
All of them drive Benz.
We cannot drive South Korean car.

228
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,025
- how many?
- Just one will do.

229
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,437
- Consider it done.
- Alright.

230
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,243
Why can't I just say 'let's go'

231
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,347
No way. He will get suspicious.

232
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:34,153
<i>Congratulation/ Mr. PARK Soo-Dong's
visiting to hometown in North Korea.</i>

233
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,616
Aren't you the PARK's son?

234
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,017
Ah yeah, how are you?

235
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:11,528
Time changed you so. I can't recognize you at all.
Wow, completely different person.

236
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,827
- Is dad inside?
- He's gone.

237
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:18,630
- Gone where?
- Maybe yesterday?

238
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,035
Maybe today.
He said he's going to his hometown.

239
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,039
Where? Hometown, where?

240
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,335
Dad!

241
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,036
Hey!

242
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:37,145
We've met once before, remember?
We should get to your hometown.

243
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:39,348
I'm not going.

244
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,655
If you don't go, I'm a dead meat.

245
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,058
No! I'm not going.

246
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:51,058
Ey! You think you will better
off without me?

247
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,568
Are you out of your mind?
No way I'm taking you.

248
00:22:54,673 --> 00:22:58,575
I'm going with you.

249
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,201
I'm the one who has been putting
food in your mouth.

250
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,802
Ok. I won't go.
Woman, you've finally gone mad.

251
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,007
You are going there to see Gab-bun.
You think I don't know that?

252
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,813
Let go.
I said I'm not going.

253
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,719
I am not going.

254
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,819
I am not going.

255
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,124
- We have to go now.
- I'm not going. No.

256
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,633
Are you OK?

257
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:27,031
Oh, you were here.

258
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:33,739
Take this with you. I want you to give
these photos to my kids there.

259
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,335
I don't know
if we'll have such time for...

260
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,744
I miss them so much.

261
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,042
No. I won't go!

262
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:45,856
- His head popped!
- Dad. Dad!

263
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:50,451
- Please, don't forget. I really miss them.
- I'll make sure they get it, of course.

264
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,962
Dad! Dad! Wait up!

265
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,361
Bon voyage!

266
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:56,759
What?

267
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,962
I can't connect with Sung-Chul.
What am I gonna do with Benz?

268
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,496
Never mind. We'll take any car.
I'm hanging up.

269
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:10,203
Man-Soo, what's wrong with me?

270
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,613
Why have you done wrong?

271
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:17,416
Why let them harass you like this?

272
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,422
It's not my fault that
the movie flopped.

273
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,823
Do I get rich if the movie sells?

274
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:26,728
My dream has nothing to do with
gangster's father realizing his dream.

275
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:31,235
Why can't I be left alone?

276
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,790
Here we are.

277
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:07,497
Let's get off now.

278
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,699
- Hand me your bag.
- Don't touch it.

279
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,218
Just over that line,
is North Korea.

280
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,616
Are you Ok sir?

281
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:39,026
No! Call the Ambulence!

282
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:44,830
No. I am fine.
I have to go. Go over.

283
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:03,681
Are you parents alive, then?

284
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,085
Well, that's...

285
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:15,591
Dead? Alright.
Come with me then.

286
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,999
Shoot, I was told
never to open my mouth.

287
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,595
We must go.

288
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:25,200
Are you Ok sir?

289
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:29,303
Wellcome, comrade PARK Soo-Dong.

290
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:36,320
Welcome home!
Comrade Grandpa!

291
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:41,517
Welcome!

292
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,584
The car isn't here yet.

293
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,883
What?

294
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:40,614
We can go now.

295
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:57,127
Comrade Grandpa!
I hope you had a big breakfast.

296
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:01,171
You'll need the full stomach
for the busy day ahead.

297
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,263
Big day, it is.

298
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:07,367
I will accompany you to

299
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,277
your hometown so not to worry.

300
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:13,077
Please get in the car, now.

301
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,084
Please get in the car.

302
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,020
Let's move.

303
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:58,926
Comrade driver,
he's new in the job.

304
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,022
Please understand, comrade grandpa.

305
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,333
We haven't got all day.

306
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:14,138
Comrade, let's get to the highway.
Hurry.

307
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,647
Shit!

308
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:28,756
Finally, Grandpa KIM Soo-dong, no,
PARK Soo-dong comes back to

309
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,260
his hometown in 50 years!

310
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:35,856
20 million people of Chosun Republic!
Let's welcome him!

311
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,581
Hey, diver.

312
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,486
You'd better ask me, dad.

313
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:03,423
Why did you come after me?

314
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,018
I'm your son.

315
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:08,621
Why did you tag along,
when you should be studying?

316
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,529
So I am still your son, dad?

317
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,735
Comrade Grandpa.

318
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:23,747
You can ask me whatever you want.

319
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,450
Take me to this place.

320
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:34,157
There are many villages like this.
t looks like where I grew up.

321
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,059
What's your name, miss?
ou shouldn't call her miss, dad.

322
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,153
Oh, no never mind,

323
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,962
Comrade Grandpa.
My name is YEON Hong-Mae.

324
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:48,164
Hong-Mae. Yes. Hong-Mae,
can you take me there?

325
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,764
No. We have other place to go.

326
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:54,971
Take me there.
You said you will take me home.

327
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,071
Comrade Grandpa, don't worry.

328
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,877
What do you mean, don't worry?

329
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:01,417
I am sorry.

330
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,214
Driver, take me there,
would you?

331
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,816
Yes. Sure.

332
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,624
What do you mean, sure?
That will cost a fortune.

333
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,130
Fuck! We just say we go!

334
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,928
They say we can go.

335
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,230
Stupid moron.

336
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,532
- I'll see about that.
- No!

337
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:31,943
013503, 013503, black Benz
vehicle information please.

338
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,347
I'll have to see that.

339
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,349
No, not you!

340
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,249
Comrade Grandpa, why don't you
let him see the picture.

341
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,447
Let me take a look.

342
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:44,360
Here. We have to get there.

343
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,859
They don't know where it is.

344
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,061
We have a tour planned out already.

345
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,764
You, ingrate! Give me back
the watch you stole!

346
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,367
Watch?

347
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:04,005
3503, Black Benz, pull over.
Stop the car!

348
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,707
Why don't we pull over?

349
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:13,821
3503 Pull over to the side. Now!

350
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,324
Stop the car.

351
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:16,723
They will stop following at some point.

352
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,229
- Comrade Grandpa, are you OK?
- Okay.

353
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:26,031
You, good for nothing,
you hit somebody? What did you do?

354
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:34,441
Just beg for forgiveness.
Tell them you are sorry.

355
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:38,948
But, I didn't do anything wrong.
Stop the car.

356
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,642
Let's stop the car.

357
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,446
Stop the car now!

358
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,646
I said stop!!
Have you gone deaf?

359
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:46,348
Pull over to the side!

360
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,016
Who the hell are you?

361
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,725
Good day, officer.

362
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:27,127
I can explain everything.

363
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,926
Just calm down.

364
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:33,436
Pathetic piece of crap,
I knew it.

365
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:38,441
Not a day goes by without trouble.
Hopeless!

366
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,338
This wouldn't stop us from
going to the village?

367
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:48,852
Not at all. You have nothing to worry.

368
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,357
You people are looking for trouble.

369
00:34:54,859 --> 00:35:02,891
There are laws and principles.

370
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:07,894
Who will keep the order of our nation

371
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:16,310
if all the displaced people
pull off such thing?

372
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:22,014
Don't you see the news?

373
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:27,521
There are innumerable applicants
waiting to go to North Korea.

374
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:32,528
Do they respect the law
out of stupidity?

375
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,532
Why is this guy so quiet?

376
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,034
He doesn't talk much.

377
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,234
Listen.

378
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:51,748
If all the passers-by
pick the flowers

379
00:35:51,849 --> 00:36:03,192
on the street,
there will be none left.

380
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,689
Huh?

381
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:10,593
You look old enough to have
such common sense.

382
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:16,201
How old are you?

383
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:19,308
And that!

384
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:25,906
Display of such flag is against the law.

385
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:37,522
Which country do you belong to?

386
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:42,531
3503 Stolen vehicle! Stolen!

387
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,827
- you are under arrest.
- you stole this car?

388
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,426
- You Fucker!
- Oh, my, are you nuts?

389
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,632
What are you doing!

390
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:55,835
I am 34 years old.

391
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:58,643
What's your business in that?

392
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,011
Stop it!

393
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:03,779
Are you nuts?
Officer! open your eyes!

394
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:11,090
In the middle of the freezing cold winter,

395
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,390
what flower!

396
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,890
You son of a bitch!
Does this look like a flower to you?

397
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,596
Are you crazy?
Officer are you OK?

398
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,799
Officer!

399
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,205
Officer!

400
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,606
You son of a bitch!

401
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:29,202
You're really going mad, know.

402
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:32,111
Let me go.
Get out of my way!

403
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:42,116
Are you OK?

404
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:44,226
Get in the car. In the car!

405
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,520
What flower?

406
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,430
Hurry up.

407
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:53,526
Let's get out of here.

408
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,538
Damn it!

409
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,468
Start the car!

410
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,083
How can you bring a stolen car?

411
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,181
I told you I borrowed it.

412
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,187
What is going on?

413
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,696
Just tell them you are sorry.
You good for nothing!

414
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,900
34 years means you were born
with sign of rat.

415
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:35,205
Why?

416
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,511
I am 35, Pig.

417
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,913
So?

418
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,816
Just telling you.

419
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:54,521
Oh no. what are we going to do?

420
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,931
- Grandpa has wet His pants...
- I'm ok. It's fine.

421
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:01,061
- Grandpa!Are you OK?
- I'm ok.

422
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,970
First? It's me.

423
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:26,087
Dad, get out of the car.
Let's get you changed.

424
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,188
I'm ok.

425
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,789
Give me your bag.

426
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:33,900
No way I step out of the car.
You try to get rid of me?

427
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,701
- Give me the bag.
- Not a chance.

428
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,300
Let him be.

429
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,005
I think you're Ok.

430
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:54,114
Who do you think you are?

431
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,223
What are you trying to pull here?

432
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,627
This kind of village might be all over
where you come from,

433
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,226
but to recreate that here cost a fortune.

434
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,929
I am sorry.

435
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,237
I don't need an uncontrollable mouth
like you. Go home.

436
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,239
Mr. Director,

437
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:23,553
we should still get him to change
his pants.

438
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:28,250
He must be cold in those wet pants.

439
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,355
Let's get him changed first...

440
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,562
I must ask you a favor.

441
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:43,266
Shoot!

442
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:49,074
It is rather to clarify
the situation.

443
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,075
This trip strictly has to follow
my instruction.

444
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,984
I am the one who takes responsibility

445
00:40:57,087 --> 00:40:59,487
when something goes wrong.

446
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,526
So you mean, you are the boss.

447
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,925
No, it's not about being a boss.

448
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,931
I'm talking about the responsibility.

449
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,536
So you are not the boss?

450
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:18,831
It is not the issue of who is the boss.

451
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:21,843
It seems like you are the boss.

452
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:24,244
I'm gonna crazy!
What's wrong with this guy!

453
00:41:24,348 --> 00:41:26,942
Is that the only way to explain
the world to you?

454
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:31,249
There are more things in the world.

455
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:35,553
So you want to be the boss,
the point is.

456
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:49,069
Fine! I am the boss and you
are just along for a ride.

457
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:53,576
But my life depends on this.

458
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:58,376
Life? Right!

459
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:05,319
That's cool, boss.

460
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:08,915
I'm going mad.

461
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:40,155
Hey, Lieutenant, feeling comfy?
Get up!

462
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,654
I'll get them car thieves.
Where? Stop right there.

463
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,861
Yes, I missed this taste.

464
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:59,468
Hanheung noodle is original here.

465
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,198
If you make it with Han Gang river water,
it'd only be Hang Gang noodle.

466
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,798
Don't you agree, Comrade Grandpa?

467
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:08,503
Where are you from?

468
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:17,113
Thank you. Thank you.

469
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:20,713
Thank you.

470
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:30,032
Excuse me, do you have
anything to drink?

471
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,625
Dad, no. No alcohol.

472
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,237
Why not. A drink to go along with the food
he missed so much.

473
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:43,939
You little rat. She says it's OK.
What's it to you?

474
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:49,947
Wow, nice atmosphere. Huh?

475
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:57,256
Redecorated the place?

476
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,953
If you were to make a movie,

477
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:06,993
you first should've
gotten permission.

478
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:11,702
Why did you have to come to our town
to turn it into North Korea?

479
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:17,213
People in this village died to protect
their home during Skull battle,

480
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:21,717
Eagle peak battle,
and what else?

481
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,411
- What?
- Haengju battle.

482
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,420
Yeah, did you hear that?

483
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:34,927
What is this?
This is not our food.

484
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:39,128
Where is ostrich meat?
That's what we are famous for.

485
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,726
Yeah, the ostrich.
Ostrich!

486
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:46,743
Oy! You fatzo!
You laughing at me? Huh?

487
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,042
Ouch! You're gonna hit me?

488
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,450
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

489
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:02,082
Who is the director? I need to be
compensated for emotional distress.

490
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,090
Why don't you tell me.

491
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:06,185
This is not your place to get involved.

492
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,988
Which one of you is the director?

493
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:12,899
Don't you know that we are working

494
00:46:13,003 --> 00:46:15,699
for unification of the country.

495
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,907
You are too small beat up.

496
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:20,601
What is the guy?

497
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:27,913
Guys, sit down. Don't run.
You should take responsibility of your action.

498
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:35,525
Wow, you must be an actress, sugar!

499
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:40,120
Stupid jerk,
who said you can call me like that.

500
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,324
Didn't your mother teach you
how to behave?

501
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:46,027
Marines aren't supposed to mess
with women.

502
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,127
- Shut your face!
- Oh my.

503
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:52,937
You should consider yourselves lucky.

504
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,145
My parents died in

505
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:03,083
Manchuria fighting the Japanese.

506
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,679
What kind of life is that?

507
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:13,591
Come and have a drink with me.

508
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,398
- Wow, the actress is buying.
- Good!

509
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,698
Here, give us five bottles of
Soju and squid.

510
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:27,801
Soju? What for?
Goryangju 20 bottles please.

511
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,613
Bottoms up!

512
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:44,724
Drink.

513
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,733
Hey, Ostrich!

514
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:05,078
Aren't you sleeping, yet?

515
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,776
Are you awake?
How do you feel?

516
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,979
I displayed quite an embarrassing scene
tonight, I guess.

517
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,282
Not at all.

518
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:19,088
Look, Grandpa, look.
There is no more programs for tonight.

519
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:23,098
Let me watch it.

520
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,795
Today's program is over.

521
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,701
You, son of a bitch!

522
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:34,601
Do you have something to tell me?

523
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:40,215
I wanted to say thank you.

524
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:44,413
- Don't mention it.
- Director PARK.

525
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:47,517
- What?
- Director PARK.

526
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,525
You should go see Grandpa Pear
in his room.

527
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,027
- What?
- you should go see in His room.

528
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:58,527
I just want to catch up with the news
of my home town.

529
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,569
Holy shit.

530
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:10,771
Comrade Grandpa insists on watching TV.
There is no stopping him.

531
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,075
Boss.

532
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,385
- Start setting up.
- Yeah. Huh?

533
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:30,196
Shooting, shooting. Get up!

534
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,291
Ugh... what shooting?

535
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:34,595
Get ready in two minute.

536
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:40,198
Wake up,

537
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,709
What's this?

538
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,509
You are going to help me.

539
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:55,822
Out of the way.
You're blocking the TV.

540
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:05,031
Yes. Dad. It's working now.

541
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:14,935
Today, Grandpa PARK Soo-Dong arrived
through Panmunjeom to visit his home town.

542
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:20,349
People who witnessed this historical moment
were overcome by tears of joy.

543
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,351
This is how one of them
expressed her welcome.

544
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,051
I just wish you take some good photos
when you go.

545
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:33,153
- And enjoy your Hanheung noodle.
- Thank you. Thank you.That was delicious...

546
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:40,961
Welcome. Let me introduce you
the famous Ostriches of North Korea.

547
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:46,673
This one's Southy and that's Northy.

548
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:48,176
I can sing.

549
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:49,870
I can fly to the sky.

550
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,470
I am stronger than you.

551
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,981
I am not really an ostrich but a crane.

552
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,678
- If you are a crane, I am a dragon.
- I am God.

553
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,584
I am the red devil.

554
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,212
How come you are the red devil.

555
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:03,417
This is what their fight had come to.

556
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,619
<i>quack</i>

557
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,218
Let's not fight.

558
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,223
Finally, we will finish today's program
with a visual message from South Korea.

559
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:15,634
We wish you a pleasant dream.

560
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:25,440
I miss you sister.

561
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:31,852
Your name is PARK Ok-Rye
and I am PARK Ok-Soon.

562
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,652
I've missed you so much
my one and only sister.

563
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:46,869
You must not die until the day
we meet and hold hands.

564
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:52,374
I wait for our reunion
day and night.

565
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:58,472
Live long so we can meet. I miss you.

566
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,718
That's our village on TV.

567
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,120
That's where we are.

568
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,833
Hah, our town's on TV.

569
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,018
- Yes, boss.
- Everything's going well?

570
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,213
Everything is going well.

571
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,916
Good work.

572
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,219
What's up?

573
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:20,729
But I am afraid we'll need
more money though.

574
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:24,823
- What money?
- We need to build a little village.

575
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,732
Did you screw up?

576
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:30,237
Movies aren't made easy.

577
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,138
We have to put our lives on the line.

578
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:34,540
Who's dead?

579
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:37,238
No, no one got killed.

580
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:42,341
- I mean, we put our lives to complete...
- you think you are a movie director?

581
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,647
Do your job and keep your eyes
on the rat next to you.

582
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:45,345
Sure thing boss.

583
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:49,255
- Be straight!
- I understand.

584
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:03,196
It isn't easy to trick him.

585
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:11,012
My father never held my hand.

586
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:17,612
I only feared him and

587
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,919
wished him dead.

588
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,823
He passed away a few years ago.

589
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,323
I must be getting
punished right now.

590
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:37,033
Have you ever held
your father's hand?

591
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,835
I'm an orphan.

592
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,093
No one is here yet?

593
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:04,498
Chop chop!

594
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,004
hurry up

595
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:18,606
you have to memorize this lines.

596
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,924
- Nothing for me?
- You're a prop.

597
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:33,325
I don't have a line.

598
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,829
You cannot handle it.

599
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:36,023
First, how is it going?

600
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,624
We are ready as ever be. Perfect.

601
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,829
You've been doing a wonderful job.

602
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,032
Let's hold out one more day.

603
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,837
- Fighting!
- Fighting.

604
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,536
- Photographer?
- Yeah.

605
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:55,646
Not here yet?
What was perfect then?

606
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:19,600
What kind of nude photography shoot
is in such early hour?

607
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,300
hello

608
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,207
Who's in charge?

609
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,805
A terrible thing happened.

610
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,907
- Why?
- Comrade Grandpa has disappeared.

611
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,110
What?

612
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,517
He's not there?

613
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,020
- have you seen him?
- No.

614
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:36,217
- have you seen him?
- No.

615
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,520
Grandpa?

616
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:43,525
Some strange old man was looking for
some Gamma park or something.

617
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,033
Which way did he go?

618
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,229
I told him I don't know where that is.

619
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:50,033
Some clever guy.

620
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,735
Don't go anywhere.

621
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,336
Hey!

622
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:12,591
Where are you going, dad?

623
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,489
You shouldn't wander around alone.

624
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:21,395
Who are you?

625
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:28,911
Half wit, sly rat, stupid moron son.

626
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,306
I've come to take you
to your home town.

627
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:39,116
Liar! You? My son?

628
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,325
Don't you think
I'd recognize my own son?

629
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:53,634
Come clean.

630
00:57:54,637 --> 00:58:00,075
You sold that watch, didn't you?

631
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:09,382
Comrade Grandpa, Comrade Grandpa.

632
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:16,088
Take me home.

633
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:19,187
They won't let me see my home town.

634
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:23,894
Let's go. We're almost there.
Just over that hill.

635
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,097
Yes. It's time to go to your home town.

636
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:57,422
<i>Gaema Plateau.</i>

637
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,065
Dad. We are here.

638
00:59:16,986 --> 00:59:18,977
Here is Gaema Plateau.

639
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,502
Come and see.

640
00:59:44,614 --> 00:59:48,914
This is Gaema national park.
Beautiful, isn't it?

641
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:53,616
Comrades,
let us enjoy the view of Gaema plateau.

642
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:55,020
It is nice here.

643
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:57,615
Let's take a picture.

644
00:59:58,227 --> 01:00:00,127
Over here.

645
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:04,928
Excuse me,
where is Pungsan village?

646
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,429
Where?

647
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:17,636
Dad. Let's take a picture.

648
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,738
A picture? What for?

649
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,750
Comrade Grandpa,
this is Gaema Plateau.

650
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,342
Do you like it?

651
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:29,153
Yes. You must bring back
a photo and

652
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,352
remember to come back later.

653
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:38,065
Comrade Grandpa,
this is a good spot for a photo.

654
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,862
Take a picture.

655
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:45,874
Dad, stand here...
great.

656
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,115
Hong-Mae,

657
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,825
this is not the place.

658
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,228
You said...

659
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,935
You said you will take me
to this place.

660
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:20,032
Yes we'll go after you
take the picture.

661
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:26,446
Dad, we only got permission
for taking picture here.

662
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,449
She says we can go.

663
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:32,644
I have to go.

664
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,656
Dad, I understand.

665
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,551
Say something to him.

666
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:42,654
Well, let's go.

667
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,365
What?
What did you say?

668
01:01:50,973 --> 01:01:53,066
How can you say something you
cannot take responsibility for.

669
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,872
- We'll just go.
- where can We find such place now?

670
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,171
You said somewhere's
gotta be like that.

671
01:01:58,281 --> 01:01:59,373
I'm gonna crazy.

672
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:02,212
I told you movie is not that easy.

673
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,309
You can't just cut
in and make decisions.

674
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,412
I cannot carry out
my job like that.

675
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:11,222
Your job is to take him
to his home town.

676
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:13,227
You should've said this
from the beginning.

677
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,024
He says this is not it.

678
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:16,223
He'll listen to you.

679
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,425
You can take care of it.
I don't know anymore.

680
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:22,229
- I can't
- Why can't you, now?

681
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,633
We go if he wants to go.

682
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,438
You're not making sense.

683
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:29,841
Fuck.

684
01:02:31,047 --> 01:02:32,947
He is the father of our boss.

685
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:35,347
Do whatever you want.
I don't know now.

686
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:41,952
You! Why you have so much
to say about everything?

687
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,650
Watch it.

688
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:48,857
You never done a movie?
Who's your agent?

689
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:50,557
A movie is made only

690
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:53,863
when actors follow
the director's order

691
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,767
You must trust him.

692
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:58,568
- Isn't it, director PARK?
- Some nutcase...

693
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:02,105
What did you say?

694
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,508
Seriously...
don't make me upset.

695
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:07,413
Well? You jerk!
Go ahead, hit me!

696
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,417
make off

697
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:12,113
- Let's see who hurts who.
- What's gotten into you? Stop.

698
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,813
hit me!

699
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:15,616
- Director! Director!
- Why?

700
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:18,125
- We have to wrap.
- Why do We have to wrap?

701
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,718
You, bastard!
It doesn't depend on you

702
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:24,231
Come here!

703
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,925
Hey!

704
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:28,629
Why can't you stop
hitting people?

705
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:33,038
- Why don't you hit again?
- Come here!

706
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,136
- Hit me!
- What are you, bitch!

707
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,642
They want to go home. They say they will
leave unless they get paid now.

708
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:37,542
- I said I'll pay them.
- We don't have the money.

709
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,740
We spent all of
it to build the sets.

710
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:41,546
Hey!

711
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,448
Keep working,

712
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:47,751
I'll get the money

713
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:52,260
Shut your face,
you think you are the director?

714
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,352
You are crazy acting like
you are in charge.

715
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,863
Stop please.
I'm begging you.

716
01:04:04,106 --> 01:04:05,403
I am sorry.

717
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:09,808
This kid doesn't know
how the world works.

718
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:12,904
He always uses trick

719
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:15,916
and live loosely in South Korea.

720
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:20,216
- You got it wrong. Please!
- You rat!

721
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,814
Don't come if you don't want to.

722
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:26,417
This half wit, sly rat, moron.

723
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:31,330
We'll go without him.

724
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:34,625
Yes. Let's go.

725
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:37,831
Stupid son of a bitch,
still hasn't come to your sense?

726
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,842
- You don't know anything!
- Fuck. I can't take this anymore.

727
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:58,859
Here we are, everyone,
this is Gaema Plateau.

728
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:01,589
We came here.

729
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:06,896
There seems to be
a film shoot.

730
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:10,598
You can stay for
a while and take pictures.

731
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:11,798
What the hell is that?

732
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,307
- What the hell...
- Hey, hey!

733
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,107
Get lost!

734
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:32,026
This isn't your playground.
Son of bitch!

735
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,619
Son of bitch!

736
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,223
Why are youguys come in a band
and mess around, son of bitch!

737
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:43,637
Stupid sons of bitches.

738
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,142
Get in the bus
or you'll get slapped.

739
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:56,045
Son of bitches!

740
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,989
Where are you going?

741
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,306
Where are you going? Huh?

742
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,002
Where? Take me with you.

743
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,815
- where are We going?
- to get money.

744
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,716
Your boss said no.

745
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,729
Even if we get the money
how can we find a studio?

746
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,428
That man.

747
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,127
Who?

748
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:50,435
Al... with a nail in the eye.

749
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:51,938
Al Pacino?

750
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,539
What does he do nowadays?

751
01:06:56,846 --> 01:07:00,873
You can't just barge
in demanding money, you know?

752
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:06,387
He doesn't pay even
when we ask him.

753
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,980
He's certainly not going to
pay when we do nothing.

754
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,184
He's always got cash.

755
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:16,794
can I ask you something?

756
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,299
What?

757
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,200
Grandpa Pear keeps talking
about the watch.

758
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,397
What is it?

759
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:29,001
A watch?
Ah that watch.

760
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:34,606
The story goes.

761
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,816
He learned to fix watches...

762
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:42,516
from a man with a wen.

763
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:48,420
While he was at it...

764
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:51,329
he also fell in love with
his daughter Gab-Bun.

765
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:59,541
You half wit, sly rat, moron.

766
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,167
Grandpa Pear soon
became skillful

767
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:04,769
and traveled around
the country fixing clocks.

768
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,575
Unfortunately...

769
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:14,282
the war broken
when he was working in Seoul.

770
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:18,884
That watch given by
the dying teacher is

771
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,791
the only thing that connected
him to his home.

772
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,594
He couldn't go back.

773
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,101
Since then, he married
in South Korea and had a son.

774
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:31,298
But he couldn't adapt to his new life.
It was't a good influence to a kid.

775
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,808
He probably wore
his father's watch

776
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,105
to the beach as a teenager
and lost it.

777
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:40,708
He still takes us to
the beach every year

778
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,807
and makes us look for the watch.

779
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,615
What is it?

780
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,120
What's going on?

781
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,666
How have you been, KIM?

782
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:02,967
What we have here?
Seong-Chul?

783
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,264
What brings you here in
such late hour.

784
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,273
Pay me back some money.

785
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,777
- What money?
- Money you borrowed.

786
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,874
It is not due till a month later,
you crazy son of a bitch.

787
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,383
Still, give me the money.

788
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,986
This is not what we agreed.

789
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:22,484
Agreement?

790
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,885
You told me to be straight
and punctual.

791
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,491
Sorry I am late, boss.

792
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,791
What the hell, communists!

793
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:37,300
Agreement can be broken.

794
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,101
You, son of bitch!

795
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:41,005
What the fuck are you doing
bitch!

796
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,102
You're mad. Insane!

797
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:44,304
I did wrong.

798
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,812
Put it in the bag.

799
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:49,009
What What?

800
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,018
Get the money.

801
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,220
You son of bitch!
Come here.

802
01:09:55,424 --> 01:09:57,119
Get the money quickly.

803
01:09:58,928 --> 01:10:02,921
I'll explain it
to the boss later, OK?

804
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:06,733
What agreement?

805
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:09,235
Nobody agreed for you
to be born?

806
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,829
- Stupid motherfucker!
- You son of bitch!

807
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:13,238
Now, run.

808
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,946
You said you have
money to collect.

809
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,650
This is stealing not collecting.

810
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,454
You've got a big mouth.

811
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,953
I don't want to get shot.

812
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,161
They are following us.
Throw the money.

813
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,461
They are getting on my nerves.

814
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,469
Go away before I count to three.

815
01:10:52,281 --> 01:10:55,079
One two three.

816
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:57,674
Why are you doing this!

817
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,777
He is coming closer, towards us.

818
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:01,116
You want a face to face?

819
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,623
Brace yourselves, here I come.

820
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:04,818
That's Benz.

821
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,623
Youth knows no turning back.
Drive on.

822
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:14,825
Are you nuts?

823
01:11:14,937 --> 01:11:17,735
Risking your life for money?

824
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,138
If you are willing to put
your life to it,

825
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:22,335
- you always win.
- Life? Life?

826
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,344
The fucking life!

827
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,243
This shit is not worth my life.

828
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,339
I have lots of things yet to do.

829
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:31,942
I still have to go to Patagonia,
make a movie.

830
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:34,352
Do you think I have to
risk my life for it?

831
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,856
- this shit?
- Yes, this shit!

832
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,252
You mean that?

833
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:42,853
Yeah! of course I mean it.
What?

834
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,159
You're gonna send me away?

835
01:11:44,266 --> 01:11:46,757
There's mountain, snow
and water here.

836
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,359
Pick your favorite.
Send me away!

837
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,562
You'd better stop.
PARK Man-Soo.

838
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:52,368
I am not finished.
Try and stop me.

839
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,771
Don't come here.
You bitch!

840
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,167
Don't come here.
Don't come near me.

841
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,178
- Let's go.
- I am Not going there.

842
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,043
- Let's go.
- I won't do it. Stay away from me.

843
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:04,117
Scared of me?
Come on!

844
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,112
- No. keep away.
- We don't have a time.

845
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:08,018
I'll throw it to you

846
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:09,522
- Let's stop and go.
- No. I'm not going.

847
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:13,220
- You are asking to be sent away.
- go head. where to? Just try.

848
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,626
Throw it.

849
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,924
Send me away.

850
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,932
- go ahead
- you think I cannot do it?

851
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:21,229
- go ahead, pathetic fool
- I'll throw it to you

852
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,328
- go ahead
- Ah, shit!

853
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:28,539
Are you alright?

854
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,039
Let's go.

855
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:34,743
Are you really OK?

856
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,545
You son of a bitch!

857
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,845
Come here!

858
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:46,159
- Come here
- Stay away!

859
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,058
- Motherfucker
- Don't come! Don't come!

860
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:10,711
OK, OK.

861
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,616
my bad.

862
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,629
What have I done wrong?

863
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,831
You certainly did nothing good.

864
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:34,935
To make a movie
You put your life to it, you said!

865
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,541
Who put their life on the line
for only a movie?

866
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,447
What?

867
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,151
It sure sounds good

868
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,554
but no movie is worth my life.

869
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,164
it is not worth it?

870
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:13,208
Where are you going?
Wait for me!

871
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,617
Hold on! Wait up! Hey!

872
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,726
Wait up!

873
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,930
Hey! Wait up!

874
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:34,832
Call the police.

875
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,030
- Hurry up.
- Yeah, Yeah.

876
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,938
Where are they headed?

877
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,540
Gaema Plateau.

878
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,745
- where?
- Gaema Plateau.

879
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:48,246
Gaema Plateau?

880
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,344
Where's that club?

881
01:14:51,854 --> 01:14:54,254
We are working to make money,
we are not going to work...

882
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:56,847
another minute
if we don't get paid.

883
01:14:56,959 --> 01:15:01,692
Listen, listen.
Money, school both important.

884
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:05,995
But what about the human dignity?

885
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:12,202
By the way, is it true that
Seong-Chul is a gangster?

886
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:15,008
Yes, I am scared of him.

887
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,805
They're coming!

888
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:38,426
What?

889
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,333
You've got nothing better to do
than fighting all day?

890
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:45,238
What happened to your face?

891
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:52,336
I am sorry about early.
I was out of line.

892
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:55,041
Not at all.

893
01:15:55,150 --> 01:16:00,383
You are really something.

894
01:16:03,992 --> 01:16:05,892
I couldn't find any studio space.

895
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,791
No way at all?

896
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:11,388
They are rented
for a week already.

897
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,994
- You should've begged.
- It's not available.

898
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:20,302
After all I've gone through
to get this money.

899
01:16:45,634 --> 01:16:49,536
I don't want to take pictures.

900
01:16:56,745 --> 01:16:58,144
Suit yourself.

901
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:07,087
Take me home.

902
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,493
OK...

903
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,391
I'll make sure you get there.

904
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,108
Sir, take me home please.

905
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:35,115
What's wrong dad?

906
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:40,211
- Sir, take me home please.
- Comrade Grandpa, are you alright?

907
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,721
Come here, please!

908
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,915
- Sir!
- Comrade Grandpa!

909
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:47,518
Comrade Grandpa, are you OK?

910
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:04,675
- What's wrong?
- Let me go.

911
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,372
Sir, where are you going?

912
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:08,881
Hey.

913
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:13,585
Which way is the Gaebau Hill?

914
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,486
Up over that hill.

915
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:18,787
Give me a ride, would you?

916
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,088
Hop on.

917
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:47,912
I am not myself.

918
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,121
What?

919
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:53,124
I keep seeing things.

920
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:58,723
It's not good, is it?

921
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,165
Don't say that.

922
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:14,681
Have ever heard the sound of...

923
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,377
flowers blooming
in Gaema plateau?

924
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:28,294
It is so cold there that
the flowers pop open all at once.

925
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:34,902
The Gaeshtang tree white flowers,

926
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:38,200
I used to picked them and eat.

927
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:41,798
The sound of
the falling flowers is amazing.

928
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:44,811
Patter, patter

929
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:50,410
You have got to witness it
once in your life.

930
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,923
Here we are.

931
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,533
It's over that bridge.

932
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:16,941
They don't let people
in there nowadays.

933
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:59,976
Mother,
your son Soo-dong is here.

934
01:22:00,048 --> 01:22:03,017
your son Soo-dong is here.

935
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:12,224
Stay there,
I'll come to you, mother.

936
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,126
your son Soo-dong is here.

937
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:23,833
your son Soo-dong is here.

938
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:47,457
Mother,
your son Soo-dong is here.

939
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:54,761
My baby.

940
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:11,608
Let me see your face.

941
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:19,320
My baby. You bastard.

942
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:25,131
I tried to come here, early
I tried.

943
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:31,127
however, who's that boy?

944
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:34,231
Who is that boy?

945
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:40,140
He's my son.

946
01:23:41,549 --> 01:23:46,953
Come and bow to
your grandmother.

947
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,148
your grandmother.

948
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:57,357
Bow to your grandmother.

949
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:07,502
He's got a job and
soon to be married

950
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:14,310
and settle down in Seoul.

951
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:20,813
You sly son of a rat.
You remarried?

952
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:24,421
No. No.

953
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:26,824
No. I would take Gab-Bun...

954
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:34,226
where did she go?

955
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:00,186
What the hell are you people?

956
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:01,785
- Fuck!What are you?
- Fuck?

957
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,490
- you scared the shit out of me.
- We're playing survivor game.

958
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,593
You scared me.

959
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:14,198
You are fake
but we are real people.

960
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,807
Have you seen Grandpa?

961
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:18,105
- No, I haven't.
- What? where did He go?

962
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,612
- He went That way.
- where, where?

963
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:21,705
- You bastards!
- Where, son of bitch!

964
01:25:24,219 --> 01:25:25,311
Stop!

965
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,718
Movies you know.

966
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:29,517
Audience wants
something more shocking...

967
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:31,819
Why don't you shut
your mouth and...

968
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:35,623
Come near to me.

969
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,823
- turn your head.
- like this?

970
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,627
Close your eyes

971
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,635
and don't worry.

972
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:44,737
Have you seen Grandpa?

973
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:04,681
Hello?

974
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:06,885
I'm calling
from Survival game park.

975
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:10,787
What?
Gaster from North Korea?

976
01:26:10,899 --> 01:26:12,890
Black Benz.

977
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:16,698
Ask if there was
a North Korean flag on the car?

978
01:26:16,804 --> 01:26:18,999
Did they have the North Korean
flag on the car?

979
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:24,403
- Dad!
- Grandpa Pear!

980
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:27,103
Grandpa Pear!

981
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,916
Dad! Where would we find him?

982
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,712
We've come too far.

983
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,123
You are a gaster
who lost the father of the boss.

984
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:40,023
That sounds bad!

985
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,323
Stop talking, kid.

986
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:49,130
- Grandpa Pear!
- Grandpa!

987
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:53,132
- Dad!
- Grandpa!

988
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:03,973
They might be here to catch us.

989
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:06,781
What the hell did we do wrong?

990
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:07,980
We cannot get caught now.

991
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,886
I've still got to make the movie...

992
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:12,585
Shut your mouse

993
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:15,094
- Dad!
- Grandpa Pear!

994
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,196
Grandpa Pear!

995
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:20,893
Hop on quickly

996
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:26,001
Run! Fast!

997
01:27:44,225 --> 01:27:47,422
- where are we?
- No idea.

998
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:55,834
- Hello?
- It's me.

999
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,029
Yes, sir.

1000
01:27:57,138 --> 01:27:59,436
- Seong-Chul there?
- one moment.

1001
01:28:00,008 --> 01:28:01,373
Hey, this is boss.

1002
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:05,170
- Yes, boss.
- Hey, you bastard.

1003
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,679
Did you beat up a cop?
And robbed a club?

1004
01:28:06,781 --> 01:28:08,476
Yes. Yes. It's no big deal.

1005
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:11,074
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1006
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:14,086
Hold on, boss.

1007
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:15,578
Take it.

1008
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:17,589
- No.
- you tell him

1009
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:20,388
You're the good liar among us.

1010
01:28:27,001 --> 01:28:28,093
Hello?

1011
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,295
- Movie director!
- Yes, it's me.

1012
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,396
So how is it going?

1013
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:33,906
Yes. Everything is going very well.

1014
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:35,805
Seon-Chul seems to
have caused trouble.

1015
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,810
What happened to my old man?

1016
01:28:37,912 --> 01:28:40,710
- Grandpa is fine.
- Really?

1017
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:44,512
Then why are the cops
looking for him?

1018
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:48,612
I simply asked you to
take a picture of him.

1019
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:50,122
Where the hell are you now?

1020
01:28:53,227 --> 01:28:54,819
We are at Gaema Plateau.

1021
01:28:54,929 --> 01:28:57,022
What?

1022
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:59,031
You should've come with us.

1023
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:05,567
Flowers are blooming and
Grandpa is very happy.

1024
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:08,870
Then you really made it there.

1025
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,377
He would've liked
you to come along.

1026
01:29:13,481 --> 01:29:15,574
OK, OK.

1027
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:18,781
Come with us next time.

1028
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:22,881
We're in North Korea.

1029
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:27,184
We shouldn't be using cell phone...

1030
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,196
- Of course. I'll hang up.
- Yes, Sir.

1031
01:29:30,298 --> 01:29:31,788
Let's meet tomorrow.

1032
01:29:31,899 --> 01:29:33,389
tomorrow...

1033
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:42,603
Thank you.

1034
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:09,234
Gab-Bun! Where are you?

1035
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:29,951
I hear something.

1036
01:30:44,972 --> 01:30:47,463
- where?
- Just go

1037
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:20,540
Hey, hey, hey, what are you up to?

1038
01:31:20,641 --> 01:31:22,040
We'll hide in here for a while.

1039
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,133
What for?

1040
01:31:24,245 --> 01:31:25,644
You have no reason to but I have plenty.

1041
01:31:25,746 --> 01:31:28,044
So you should've
stayed away from trouble.

1042
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,447
- get your ass in here.
- Alright.

1043
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:42,553
Gab-Bun! Where are you? Gab-Bun!

1044
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:54,269
Gab-Bun! Wait for me,
I'll come and find you.

1045
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:22,633
Gab-Bun!
You are Gab-Bun, aren't you?

1046
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:27,634
I thought you
were arriving yesterday.

1047
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,936
You hungry? Come in.

1048
01:32:31,045 --> 01:32:36,244
You must be Gab-Bun.
You were here.

1049
01:32:44,358 --> 01:32:47,657
You came alone?
hat about Deok-Su?

1050
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,563
I am Soo-Dong.

1051
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,062
Deok-Su is the big brother?

1052
01:32:57,171 --> 01:32:59,071
I have no brother.

1053
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:05,602
Yes. Where are you headed?

1054
01:33:07,114 --> 01:33:09,014
To Gaema Plateau.

1055
01:33:16,624 --> 01:33:18,615
Are you still single?

1056
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:23,422
I have two kids.
Both went to Seoul.

1057
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:28,534
Kids nowadays don't stay
in country with an old mother.

1058
01:33:30,137 --> 01:33:31,627
They went to Pyoungyang.

1059
01:33:34,041 --> 01:33:35,633
Fled to the South.

1060
01:33:39,146 --> 01:33:42,946
You've grown old.

1061
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:47,243
You should stay here tonight.

1062
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:50,246
I'm not going anywhere now.

1063
01:33:54,862 --> 01:34:00,698
Your eldest son is Chon-Su?

1064
01:34:01,702 --> 01:34:04,398
- Cheol-Su?
- Yes.

1065
01:34:04,505 --> 01:34:06,496
- Cheol-Su.
- Yes.

1066
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:17,410
- His name is Chon-Su?
- Right. Chon-Su.

1067
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:28,120
What's the matter?
Are you crying?

1068
01:34:30,731 --> 01:34:36,226
I am not crying? I have no tears
left being so close to my last days.

1069
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:41,240
You miss Chon-Su?
You want to see his picture?

1070
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,633
You have his picture?

1071
01:34:43,744 --> 01:34:46,440
- you want to see His picture?
- Yes.

1072
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:47,741
Wait.

1073
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:05,893
This little one.

1074
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:17,409
He looks like me, isn't he?

1075
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,303
He took after his mother.

1076
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,022
Where di you get this watch?

1077
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:35,925
You want it?

1078
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:48,234
Chon-Su picked it up on the beach.
It doesn't even keep the time now.

1079
01:35:48,342 --> 01:35:51,038
It's very old. You can have it.

1080
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:56,248
Why did you come so late?

1081
01:35:57,351 --> 01:36:03,381
How many time do I have to tell you?
A war broke, I barely survive.

1082
01:36:18,906 --> 01:36:24,105
The door doesn't open.

1083
01:36:24,211 --> 01:36:29,615
- Give it a good push... out of the way!
- It's locked.

1084
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:41,423
See, it's locked.
There are people here!

1085
01:36:41,529 --> 01:36:42,723
Open the door!

1086
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:45,924
- There are people here!
- Open the door!

1087
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:55,539
- There are people here!
- There are people here!

1088
01:36:57,845 --> 01:37:02,475
