1
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:42,482
This motion picture
is based on real events.

2
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:10,182
<i>EXIT ONLY</i>

3
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:17,082
<i>The train won't go any further.
Please exit the cars.</i>

4
00:01:29,143 --> 00:01:30,982
Hey, miss!

5
00:01:33,971 --> 00:01:35,783
Miss!

6
00:03:17,105 --> 00:03:22,347
STEEL BUTTERFLY

7
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:29,749
Look who's walking!

8
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,984
Charlie, come here!

9
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:49,391
Hold it, Chuma(=Plague)!
Cops!

10
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:02,316
<i>Well, do you like it?
- Yes.</i>

11
00:04:03,557 --> 00:04:05,016
Let's go!

12
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,094
In a hurry?
- What's the matter?

13
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:14,084
We have reserved a table at the café,
but forgot our money at the orphanage.

14
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:24,200
Good evening!

15
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,685
Here!

16
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,378
Check this out!

17
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:53,687
Not older than 15.
- Yes, and again with stockings.

18
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:04,782
The dog patrol lost his trail.
Apparently he got into a car.

19
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:06,407
I have no doubt.

20
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,222
This one also untouched?

21
00:05:09,624 --> 00:05:11,264
At first glance, yes.

22
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,706
What is he, impotent?
Why doesn't he at least rape them?

23
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:18,404
What?
- He might leave a trace then.

24
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:20,204
You're...

25
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,268
<i>This is the third murder
in the same area.</i>

26
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:27,226
<i>We're working on it.</i>

27
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:30,732
Well...
The subway guard recognised her.

28
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,201
She arrived after 23 o'clock.

29
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:37,235
Carrying this easel.
- Sketchbook.

30
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,314
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
- "Easel"...

31
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:45,593
Let's go. We're expected in the
guard room, at the station.

32
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:51,147
See!
Here she came out of the subway car,

33
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,407
here she took a turn,

34
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:56,578
showed up on the 7th camera,

35
00:05:57,012 --> 00:05:59,867
and was supposed to show up on the 9th,
but didn't.

36
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,621
So she was attacked somewhere here.

37
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:13,619
Now, where could he
have gotten there from?

38
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,549
From where? Anywhere.

39
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,868
The cameras show only the alleyways.

40
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:23,922
Tolya, you're a fisher or something?
- No, just occasionally.

41
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:26,449
Know what I thought?

42
00:06:26,948 --> 00:06:28,449
Roll it.

43
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,942
See that guy?

44
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,871
He came out, looked in her direction
and followed her.

45
00:06:37,706 --> 00:06:40,292
Wait a moment.
Let's see more.

46
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:45,440
See? Later he went
in the opposite direction.

47
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:49,360
Exactly. He could have
bypassed the station,

48
00:06:49,677 --> 00:06:51,553
and intercepted her here.

49
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:05,750
No. A maniac would not hang around
on the platform with a beer.

50
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,267
Charlie, what did you buy?

51
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,767
It would have been twice cheaper
in the tunnel!

52
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:26,995
You don't like something, Charlie?

53
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,237
No, I just mentioned it.

54
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:34,416
Wafer, can you
put it all in your mouth?

55
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,698
Put the money down first.

56
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,093
Chuma, give me to drink.

57
00:07:59,497 --> 00:08:01,489
Don't give her,
she'll suck it all up.

58
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,310
Get lost.

59
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,067
What?

60
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:20,257
Chuma, let's get glue
for the rest of the money.

61
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,992
Charlie, you have glue for brains.

62
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,884
If you had a lot of money,
what would you buy apart from the glue?

63
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,077
Food.
- And after you've eaten your fill?

64
00:08:31,783 --> 00:08:34,226
Chuma, one wants to eat every day.
- You don't say!

65
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,671
Wow!
Mommy!

66
00:08:39,069 --> 00:08:41,905
Let's answer to Mommy!
- Sure, go ahead.

67
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:43,928
Hello?

68
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:45,983
That's me, Mom.

69
00:08:46,786 --> 00:08:51,760
I just drank some cold beer
with the boys, here at the bar.

70
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:55,855
Your son will be late, Mommy!
He is resting in the nature.

71
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:58,055
Very, very late!

72
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,482
Get up everybody! Quickly!

73
00:09:05,891 --> 00:09:08,463
Come on! It's not like
you haven't been here before.

74
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,148
I'm listening.

75
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,948
Hi.

76
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:14,644
Who's that, Chumakova?

77
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:17,026
None other.
- Long time no see.

78
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:20,623
Where do we keep the juvenile statistics?
- In the 2nd box.

79
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:30,553
Asfaltzavod village, Trudovaya street,
Shatura Orphanage.

80
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,908
Why's it so hard
to stay where you belong?

81
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,160
I'm a free person
in a free country.

82
00:09:37,671 --> 00:09:40,448
I felt like going for a ride and I did.
- Don't get smart with me.

83
00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:43,396
I have a whole dossier "Chumakova".

84
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:47,260
To which I will add a robbery
with grievous bodily harm.

85
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:50,425
Why robbery?
I didn't pull the knife.

86
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,060
Tell it in court.
Maybe they'll believe.

87
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:54,921
What kind of a knife was it?

88
00:09:55,264 --> 00:09:56,746
May I smoke?

89
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,546
Let me see.

90
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:03,681
Wow.
You're done for, kid.

91
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,975
You will remember Shatura Orphanage

92
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:10,266
as the most beautiful years
of your life.

93
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:16,296
Look, guys:
are you not fucking her or what?

94
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:18,468
You have to make yourself to,

95
00:10:18,695 --> 00:10:20,205
otherwise it can cost you dearly.

96
00:10:20,383 --> 00:10:23,100
Why couldn't the maniac
have strangled that trash?

97
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,091
One feels sorry
for the good girls,

98
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,612
but no one wouldn't even notice
if this one were dead!

99
00:10:39,154 --> 00:10:41,993
What kind of a maniac
would fancy those?

100
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:54,239
Well, boys, what do you say?

101
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,280
One can see a setup
from a mile's distance.

102
00:10:58,642 --> 00:11:00,393
We need an actual minor.

103
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:02,062
Are you crazy?

104
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,593
They can at least break loose,
but what could a child do?

105
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:09,599
Lyuda, you look like a mad hooker.

106
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,457
You think I'm enjoying this?

107
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:17,913
Like I've nothing else to do than
walk around in the woods without pants.

108
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,339
Well, Nikita,
what did you draw?

109
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:30,463
Look at this! He'll be a cop.
- Nikita!

110
00:11:31,803 --> 00:11:33,363
Off you go.

111
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:35,363
Come on.

112
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:38,389
All right, girls,
let's call it an evening. Go home.

113
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:41,614
But not in that attire,
or a divorce is guaranteed.

114
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,025
So, Maslova, you did not hit him?

115
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,825
No.
- Only Chumakova did?

116
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,564
Yes.
- How many times?

117
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,346
Three.
- Three times? And you didn't hit?

118
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:13,663
No, I'm afraid of blood.
- You don't say!

119
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:16,294
Tamara Nikolayevna,
can you spare a moment?

120
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,381
<i>Talk please.
I'm listening to you.</i>

121
00:12:19,993 --> 00:12:21,481
Sit still!

122
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:42,782
I can't! I just can't.
We have the victim's complaint,

123
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,307
and everything has been registered.
- I'll take care of the victim.

124
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:50,109
We can replace the documents in the
registry. It's not the first time.

125
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:52,583
Do you realise that
no one will be looking for her.

126
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,573
No, Hanin. She is overdue for prison.
Got it?

127
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:59,554
Why do you worry? If she won't go now,
she certainly will in a year.

128
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,615
Come on. Tamara.
Let us agree.

129
00:13:03,422 --> 00:13:05,207
You're not getting it,
are you, Grisha?

130
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,707
The way she humiliated me
in front of all,

131
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:10,674
she'll go in and stay in
until I retire.

132
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:13,150
I won't give her to you!
Understood?

133
00:13:13,704 --> 00:13:17,506
I'm sorry. Of course.
I didn't realise.

134
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:23,482
Oh, Tamara, I almost forgot.
I wanted to tell you something.

135
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,822
We busted a brothel gang recently.
- <i>Let me pass, guys.</i>

136
00:13:26,957 --> 00:13:29,348
There were two minors, 14 years old.
- So?

137
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:31,995
Would you believe:

138
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,768
They both wrote that it was you
who sold them to the pimps.

139
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,068
<i>...do you realise
a person has disappeared...</i>

140
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,994
For 500 USD a piece.

141
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,606
You trying to scare me or something?

142
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,941
Please...

143
00:13:50,775 --> 00:13:52,214
You think I believed them?

144
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,568
They tore those papers up
in front of my eyes,

145
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,967
and ate them without water.

146
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:03,957
Bring her to me, Tamara.

147
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,406
I did those minors a service.

148
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,973
They are being fucked
just as they used to be,

149
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,394
only between clean sheets
and for money, not in a cellar.

150
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:21,397
But you would put a girl to knife
to get a kiss from the superiors.

151
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,468
Keep your ideals.

152
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:32,781
It's very simple:

153
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:36,060
You'll carry a transmitter.

154
00:14:36,366 --> 00:14:38,108
We will follow your movements.

155
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:40,695
The transmitter has an alarm button.

156
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:43,207
Don't worry.
We'll set up your route so,

157
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,663
that we'll be no more than
20 seconds away.

158
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,688
You press the button,
and we'll take him.

159
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:53,270
And what if he'll stab me?

160
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,053
He strangles.
He doesn't carry a knife.

161
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:58,045
Are you sure or do you believe so?

162
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:00,921
It's possible to stab a person to death
in a few seconds.

163
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,990
Yes, there is risk.

164
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:06,385
Otherwise I could take
just any schoolgirl.

165
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,773
You wear your alarm button
and I'll sit and watch.

166
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,270
In the prison!
That's where you will sit!

167
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:30,980
Look, Chuma.
I didn't pick you just like that.

168
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:35,198
You're different from those
worms of yours, aren't you?

169
00:15:41,616 --> 00:15:44,396
Will you let me go until tomorrow?
I've got some business.

170
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:46,302
Why are you bothering with her, Hanin?

171
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:49,335
I'll bring you a dozen girls
from any shelter.

172
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,172
You won't get anyone like me.
- Shut it up!

173
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:06,398
Now, make sure you're here
tomorrow at 9:00.

174
00:16:07,214 --> 00:16:10,945
If you don't show up,
I'll find you from the end of the world.

175
00:16:11,128 --> 00:16:12,686
Have you lost your mind?

176
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:16,433
The butterfly!

177
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,260
Let's go!

178
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,619
Quietly and without tricks!
- Why are you shouting at me?

179
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,352
Is it true?

180
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,386
Take me home, guys.

181
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,586
Is it true, Grisha?

182
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:00,161
What are chewing all the time, Zaitsev?

183
00:17:04,972 --> 00:17:06,665
Do you really think she'll show up?

184
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,049
Can you imagine the trouble we're in
if this leaks out?

185
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,095
Enough!

186
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:30,137
Hi, Vika, dear!
Where have you been?

187
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:32,988
I tried to call you.
Where were you?

188
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,940
My number has changed.

189
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:41,812
What a story I'll tell you now,
Kostya!

190
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:51,680
Knocks your socks off.

Yes, Tanya!

00:18:15,777 --> 00:18:17,285
Hello!

195
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,247
Hanin!

196
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:25,792
Hanin! If you don't want me,
just tell me so. Got it?

197
00:18:26,823 --> 00:18:28,643
After all, I'm not a hooker.

198
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,352
I'm fed up with that once a week thing.
Only once a week! I...

199
00:18:38,562 --> 00:18:40,354
Drop me off at the Cinema Centre.

200

202
00:19:08,502 --> 00:19:10,595
When will your ancestors be home?

203
00:19:11,414 --> 00:19:13,661
The day after tomorrow. Why?

204
00:19:15,146 --> 00:19:16,861
Just asking.

205
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:20,966
Stop! Stop! Stop!

206
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,066
Hanin!

207
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:26,466
Yes, yes. It's me, Hanin.
- Hanin...

208
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,366
Hanin...
- Stand!

209
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:33,587
All right?
Hold this!

210
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,187
So...
- Hanin!

211
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:40,987
Easy, easy. Come on!

212
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,687
So... Going in.

213
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,697
That's it. Easy now.
- Hanin, I had only 4 mojitos.

214
00:19:49,912 --> 00:19:51,694
Where are you taking me, Hanin?

215
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:55,827
That's it. We're there.
- Where?

216
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,760
Where?
- To sleep.

217
00:19:57,995 --> 00:20:00,774
Hanin, I want you!
- Enough. Go to sleep.

218
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:05,869
Come on. Enough.
- But... Hanin!

219
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:10,969
Sleep yourself sober.

220
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,397
No, I've changed my mind.

221
00:21:05,117 --> 00:21:07,077
Kostya!
- What?

222
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:08,787
Kostya!

223
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,291
Do me a massage.

224
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:14,256
Vika, I don't know how.

225
00:21:14,576 --> 00:21:16,337
Do what you can.

226
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,443
Kostya!

227
00:21:25,341 --> 00:21:26,895
Well?

228
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:32,295

bunks, bunks.

230
00:21:34,823 --> 00:21:36,600
Enough! Hands off!

231
00:21:37,536 --> 00:21:40,208
Screw you, Vika!
My mother used to do it like that.

232
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:58,466
Kostya!
- What?

233
00:22:00,591 --> 00:22:02,080
Let's change the channel!

234
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:06,618
No, we won't change the channel.

235
00:23:11,432 --> 00:23:16,204
<i>Don't think about the seconds
from high above.</i>

236
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,904
Just singing.

237
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:25,558
Guys, do you remember
Zoya from the archives?

238
00:23:25,932 --> 00:23:29,815
Yeah.
- She's kind of slim and petite.

239
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:34,965
I was thinking:
why don't we send her to the park?

240
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,228
She has a limp.
- She does?

241
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,672
Yeah.
- I haven't noticed.

242
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:44,807
She's not coming.

243
00:23:45,537 --> 00:23:47,181
I wouldn't.

244
00:24:02,804 --> 00:24:04,714
<i>I'm going in! Got it?
- Enough!</i>

245
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:07,514
<i>I am going there today!
Don't touch me!</i>

246
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:09,771
<i>Go outside!
You're in the way.</i>

247
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,269
<i>Check your list! Chu-ma-ko-va!
- You are not on the list.</i>

248
00:24:13,534 --> 00:24:17,230
You're not going in without a document.
Go wait on the street.

249
00:24:17,387 --> 00:24:19,643
I'm working here, dumbass!
Call Hanin!

250
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:23,069
Bitch, how dare you speak to me like that?
- See? There he is!

251
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:27,545
Look, your lackey won't let me in!

252
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:30,548
Learn how to talk to people!
Got it?

253
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,348
Let her pass.
She has come to see me.

254
00:24:34,522 --> 00:24:36,064
Understood?

255
00:25:36,318 --> 00:25:38,639
Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon. I need stockings.

256
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,566
How much den?
- How much...

257
00:25:48,394 --> 00:25:50,790
We need one. One pair.

258
00:25:52,137 --> 00:25:54,693
You see, "den" indicates
the density of the fabric.

259
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,333
It can be 5, 10, 15...
It can be 40,

260
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:02,503
but those are quite dense.
For what purpose do you need them?

261
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:05,160
To arouse a maniac.
- Don't.

262
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:08,357
How much den do we need?

263
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,570
It's too expensive.
Come, I know where it's cheaper.

264
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,649
Sorry.

265
00:26:24,885 --> 00:26:26,489
You pinched it?
- Yes.

266
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:28,563
A real beauty, you are.

267
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,529
Buy me cigarettes, thin ones with menthol.
- You need a beating, not cigarettes.

268
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:36,199
If you think I'm going to
spend money on you, forget it!

269
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:38,819
Suck a dick!

270
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,646
If you ever say anything like that
to me again,

271
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:46,125
I promise I'll put you in prison.
Got it?

272
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,291
I'm a cop, I don't give a damn.

273
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,807
Hanin!

274
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:58,133
Why are you busting your ass anyway?
You don't feel sorry for them.

275
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:02,154
Whom?
- Whom? Those who got murdered.

276
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,348
My job is to look for the criminal,
not to pity.

277
00:27:10,856 --> 00:27:13,038
What's this?
You should warn people.

278
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:15,217
What's the matter?
Never seen it before?

279
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:17,451
Take this.

280
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,387
What's this crap for?

281
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:25,144
You see, one victim was carrying a violin,
another one an easel.

282
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,915
Yeah, he likes nice girls.

283
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:35,906
Well?

284
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:42,240
In order.

285
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,807
Take this.

286
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,696
Found this in the dumpster?

287
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:49,368
You want to get back
the one you stole?

288
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,534
Yes!
- This will do.

289
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:54,675
When I call you on this phone,

290
00:27:54,902 --> 00:27:57,475
let's limit the conversation
to the business.

291
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,908
Just don't call me Captain
when there are other people around.

292
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:07,584
As soon as you notice someone
following you with obvious intentions,

293
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,628
press this button immediately.

294
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:15,060
But if someone is
just walking nearby?

295
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:16,997
You can't afford to make a mistake.

296
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:22,077
Once we show up,
the operation will be uncovered.

297
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:26,607
Got it. I'm not to press it
until I'm already being strangled.

298
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:30,683
Don't worry, Vika. We'll be near.
- Right.

299
00:28:32,828 --> 00:28:35,454
Eat some, Vika.
You have a long evening before you.

300
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,252
Sorry, I have a special diet.

301
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:42,160
Thank you, Tolya.
We ate already.

302
00:28:43,362 --> 00:28:46,819
So, shall we?

303
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:12,683
Look at that!
- What?

304
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,131
Why did she stop?

305
00:29:15,557 --> 00:29:17,077
Can't you really guess?

306
00:29:21,535 --> 00:29:23,066
Fuck her!

307
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:02,215
Hi, guys!
- Hi!

308
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:04,943
Why are you listening to that crap?

309
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,335
<i>What?</i>
- What the hell is she up to?

310
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:11,512
Come on, put on something proper.

311
00:30:11,862 --> 00:30:13,479
Why don't you get lost?

312
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,588
Wow, what are you
blowing your lid about, jerk?

313
00:30:15,746 --> 00:30:19,242
I think it's you who is blowing her lid.
- I'll blow your lid now!

314
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:23,341
Wait! Maybe she can handle it.

315
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:28,075
Hello!
- Chumakova!

316
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:29,776
Yes, Daddy!

317
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:33,939
Get to work! Quickly!
- Sorry, Daddy! Coming!

318
00:30:34,635 --> 00:30:36,487
You're lucky. Daddy is waiting.

319
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:39,552
Get lost, bitch!
- Say hello to Daddy.

320
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,247
Slut!

321
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:44,104
I don't understand
why she picked on them.

322
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,019
It's good music.

323
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:18,874
Come on guys, it's 1 o'clock.
Let's call it an evening.

324
00:31:19,074 --> 00:31:21,215
The subway closes in 40 minutes.

325
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,992
All the murders were committed
between 23:00 and 1:00.

326
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,224
We'll have to wait it through.

327
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:30,195
Where will you put her up for the night?
- In the juvie, where else?

328
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,943
I've arranged for her
to be released every day.

329
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:36,916
This is just great!
Through the entire city at 02:00.

330
00:31:37,117 --> 00:31:39,760
Home at 03:00.
And so every day.

331
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,897
We'll go nuts.
No one will compensate the fuel.

332
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:43,498
Don't whine!

333
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:57,719
Uncle, give me a cigarette.

334
00:31:58,173 --> 00:31:59,622
Please.

335
00:32:15,092 --> 00:32:16,503
How much?

336
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:19,153
What?

337
00:32:19,853 --> 00:32:21,334
How much are you asking?

338
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:27,587
I go with the music, uncle!

339
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:48,121
Well?

340
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:54,256
Well, what are you waiting for?
An invitation? Get in.

341
00:32:55,204 --> 00:32:58,145
Where are we going?
- To a discotheque. Get in!

342
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,738
I am not going to the juvie.

343
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:03,453
You're not asked!
I'm telling you to get in the car!

344
00:33:03,635 --> 00:33:06,692
I am not going to the juvie!

345
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:11,309
She's using us
as much as she can.

346
00:33:11,707 --> 00:33:14,778
Zaitsev, you like children,
don't you?

347
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:18,466
Wow, Petya, are you in your right mind?

348
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,785
If my Masha should meet her,
she'll get completely out of control.

349
00:33:26,115 --> 00:33:30,080
Well, I can't either.
I have Yulka, Seryozha...

350
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:33,725
Hanin! You have no one,
except on Saturdays.

351
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,714
The hell I need her for.
- Well,

352
00:33:38,673 --> 00:33:40,628
it was all your idea.
- So what?

353
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,909
We are responsible for the people
whom we use in our work.

354
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:47,375
What's your problem anyway?
Put her on the couch

355
00:33:47,621 --> 00:33:49,454
and she'll be
at your beck and call.

356
00:33:53,068 --> 00:33:54,599
You guys are just great!

357
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:01,883
Come back!

358
00:34:02,992 --> 00:34:04,405
Primadonna!

359
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,142
See you tomorrow!
- Good night.

360
00:34:17,816 --> 00:34:19,753
You forgot the light on.

361
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:25,739
I don't think so.
Well, whatever. So long!

362
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:28,547
Wait for me here.
5 minutes.

363
00:35:00,355 --> 00:35:03,102
So, wash your hands,
sit down and eat.

364
00:35:04,027 --> 00:35:05,574
What's that?

365
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:08,940
Chicken legs with garlic the way you like,
and potatoes.

366
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,741
What are you doing here?

367
00:35:13,788 --> 00:35:16,654
Wanted to surprise you,
thought you'll be hungry.

368
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:21,659
Tatyana, what are we having today?

369
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:23,716
What do you mean?

370
00:35:23,898 --> 00:35:25,970
It's Monday, not Saturday.

371
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:29,643
Well, you left me the keys, I thought...
- You thought what?

372
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:32,015
That was because you were
vomiting all night.

373
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:33,872
I felt sorry to wake you up.

374
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,344
Am I a prostitute
who has to go by schedule?

375
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:41,493
Why can't I come when I miss you,
not just on Saturdays?

376
00:35:41,836 --> 00:35:44,572
Because that is not
what you and I have agreed upon.

377
00:35:45,363 --> 00:35:46,914
Besides, you didn't even ask me.

378
00:35:47,597 --> 00:35:49,809
Come on. I had a tough day.

379
00:35:50,263 --> 00:35:51,795
Tatyana!

380
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,336
Yes?

381
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,786
Leave the keys there.

382
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:01,663
Fucking prick!

383
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:21,163
Asshole!

384
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:37,402
Yes?

385
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:40,047
Second floor?
Okay.

386
00:36:56,316 --> 00:36:57,898
You will sleep here.

387
00:36:58,321 --> 00:36:59,870
There is food on the stove.
- Right.

388
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:01,945
And some sausage and tea,
you'll manage.

389
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:03,569
Aren't you going to eat?

390
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:07,468
I will drink vodka.
First a shower.

391
00:38:07,112 --> 00:38:08,672
Well, have a snack.

392
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:13,853
I don't snack after the first one.
- It's also your last.

393
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,916
Hey, I risked my life!

394
00:38:40,054 --> 00:38:41,685
Well, let's hear it then.

395
00:38:42,185 --> 00:38:46,443
What?
- About your life.

396
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,848
How'd you end up
in the orphanage?

397
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:50,530
Well, my mother's a careerist.

398
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:54,638
A prostitute, right?

399
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:59,086
Shut up! She's an opera singer.

400
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:01,794
It's already 10 years
since she went to England.

401
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:04,453
Sings in the Covent Gardent.

402
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:09,149
What are you bullshitting me for, Chuma?

403
00:39:09,944 --> 00:39:11,435
I've read your file.

404
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,510
Why do you ask me then?

405
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,685
What the hell?
- What's the matter?

406
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:39,592
You want it, don't you, Hanin? Let's do it!
- Go to sleep!

407
00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:46,457
Hanin, I know you want it.
You want it 100 per cent!

408
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:53,405
What do you think you're doing?
Damned minor!

409
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:56,481
If this ever happens again,
I'll put you in handcuffs. Understood?

410
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,928
Do you understand?

411
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:01,407
Get lost!

412
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:06,580
Hanin, what's the matter?

413
00:40:07,846 --> 00:40:09,748
Don't you like me anymore
when I'm naked?

414
00:40:11,448 --> 00:40:13,319
That's it.
Your game's over.

415
00:40:14,492 --> 00:40:17,199
What are you doing?
Let me go!

416
00:40:17,808 --> 00:40:19,944
Stand!
Get in!

417
00:40:21,216 --> 00:40:26,953
Hanin!

418
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:31,018
If I hear one more sound...
- Let me out!

419
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:32,744
...I'll lock you up in the closet!

420
00:40:35,837 --> 00:40:37,387
Hanin!

421
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:42,554
Hanin, fucking prick!

422
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:46,007
Hanin!

423
00:40:51,378 --> 00:40:55,607
Hanin...

424
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:03,607
I will break out!

425
00:41:08,178 --> 00:41:10,507
I will break out of here!

426
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:15,707
Hanin!
I'll be out of here!

427
00:42:35,395 --> 00:42:39,003
Is it so simple for you?
With an adult stranger?

428
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:42,436
Easy as blowing my nose.

429
00:42:47,347 --> 00:42:50,033
All right, Hanin.
Forget it.

430
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:51,892
What do you mean "forget it"?

431
00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:55,580
It was the vodka.
And everything that's happened.

432
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:01,042
I won't do it again.

433
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:14,306
Lazy, isn't he, our maniac?

434
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:18,937
Such a sweet bite
as your Chuma.

435
00:43:19,381 --> 00:43:21,372
Patience. It's only the second day.

436
00:43:22,857 --> 00:43:24,347
And why's it suddenly "my Chuma"?

437
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:28,235
How was the first night?
- Fuck you!

438
00:43:30,822 --> 00:43:35,863
Look, guys, it's 00:50.
Call her in.

439
00:43:55,307 --> 00:43:59,598
I just can't!
I'm no Benjamin Spock.

440
00:44:00,611 --> 00:44:03,608
I'll bring my own car
and drive her every night.

441
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:06,129
Hope you know what you're doing.

442
00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:20,301
Where are we going?

443
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:23,801
What?

444
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:35,691
Mean.

445
00:44:36,668 --> 00:44:39,603
Look... Don't start, okay?

446
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,652
No, please!

447
00:44:45,298 --> 00:44:47,816
Please, I don't want to go there.
I'm begging you!

448
00:44:48,591 --> 00:44:53,024
Don't be assholes.
Please! I'll behave.

449
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:56,840
Kolya, tell him!
- There, there. Grisha just can't.

450
00:44:57,216 --> 00:44:59,091
Calm down.

451
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:03,207
Hanin, dear, I will never again
make a pass at you! Never!

452
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:07,125
Please, I'm begging you.
Don't take me there! Please!

453
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:10,454
Stop it! Don't embarass me here.

454
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,551
No. You don't understand.

455
00:45:15,947 --> 00:45:19,800
I've been there all the time.
It's not where I belong!

456
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:23,078
Where do you belong then?
In Covent Garden?

457
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:25,853
Yes!
- Enough! Everybody calm down.

458
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,993
We'll go to my place.
- What? Got hooked already?

459
00:45:29,658 --> 00:45:32,625
She's an artist. Crying is
the easiest thing in the world for her.

460
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:34,526
I said we'll go to my place.

461
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:38,152
Hello! Larisa?
- Hi.

462
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,339
Yeah, hi.
Look, there's...

463
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,068
Let Masha sleep in our room tonight.
- Masha?

464
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:47,293
And in her room...
Well, you see.

465
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,776
What's happened?
- You know, Vika...

466
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,334
Your Vika?
- Yes, the one we are...

467
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,404
But we had an agreement about this.
Are you joking?

468
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:58,235
No, I am not joking.
- Give it to me!

469
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,590
Hello! This is Hanin.
- Grisha, what's going on?

470
00:46:00,688 --> 00:46:03,219
Calm down. Kolya is joking.
- It's not funny!

471
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:05,965
All right. That's it. Good night.
- All right. Bye.

472
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:33,264
Kennel!

473
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,812
Good morning.
- Morning.

474
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:57,006
I'm sorry.
- It's all right, forget it.

475
00:47:57,212 --> 00:47:59,439
How's the monster? Asleep?
- Seems to be.

476
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:01,385
Here. Take a look.

477
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,085
I think this'll keep you till the evening.
- Great. Thanks!

478
00:48:06,246 --> 00:48:08,517
Put it in the fridge.
I'll wait downstairs.

479
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:10,117
Okay.

480
00:48:12,508 --> 00:48:14,036
Vika!

481
00:48:15,256 --> 00:48:18,364
Food's in the kitchen.
Don't answer the phone, don't drink vodka,

482
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:21,573
don't look for cigarettes, I took them.
I'll pick you up in the evening.

483
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:23,293
I can't hear your reply!

484
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:28,193
What I have to put up with!

485
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:51,293
<i>Seryozha! Seryozha, come home!</i>

486
00:50:31,798 --> 00:50:33,287
Hello.

487
00:50:35,177 --> 00:50:36,663
Hello?

488
00:50:37,627 --> 00:50:39,107
Hello!

489
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,182
You will be silent
at the cemetery!

490
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:42,700
I... I fell asleep accidentally.
- Get dressed. It's time.

491
00:51:44,656 --> 00:51:46,745
Hanin!

492
00:51:47,895 --> 00:51:50,302
What is it?
- Just don't shout.

493
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,206
I washed your sweater.

494
00:52:06,743 --> 00:52:08,899
What's the problem?
- There.

495
00:52:22,879 --> 00:52:24,380
Fits you all right.

496
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:30,766
How did you manage that, anyway?
- I don't know.

497
00:52:32,558 --> 00:52:34,066
Go ahead, try it on.

498
00:52:59,375 --> 00:53:04,615
In short, if I don't catch him,
they'll all get their asses fired.

499
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:07,358
So they seriously
can't do without me.

500
00:53:07,661 --> 00:53:09,803
They're totally kissing up to me.

501
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:14,778
When I want to go to a shop or a cafe,
it's no problem at all.

502
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:18,419
Every evening they send a car for me
and take me to the park.

503
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,285
I have my knife, a transmitter,
everything.

504
00:53:23,145 --> 00:53:26,002
The entire park is surrounded.

505
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,846
Why did they take you anyway?
- Whom then? Wafer?

506
00:53:30,293 --> 00:53:32,529
She would piss her pants
the first evening.

507
00:53:35,592 --> 00:53:38,870
And he, you know,
fell for me at once.

508
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:43,330
He who?
- Well, he, the detective.

509
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,780
I live at his place.

510
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,047
What, actually live?

511
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:49,920
Yes, actually live.

512
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:52,074
Like husband and wife.

513
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:55,682
I cook for him.

514
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:59,321
He brings us groceries.
- But he's old.

515
00:53:59,985 --> 00:54:02,602
Look! He's not old.

516
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,423
Have you seen that commercial
where a man advertises coffee?

517
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:09,722
My one is like him.

518
00:54:11,112 --> 00:54:12,605
Only better.

519
00:54:14,595 --> 00:54:18,256
Gosha was beaten by cops the other day.
- He was taken away by the ambulance.

520
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,320
The cops are animals.

521
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:28,030
Once a cop beat me with a baton,
so that I was pissing blood a month later.

522
00:54:28,202 --> 00:54:29,793
Yeah, I remember.

523
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,649
My ones are not like that.

524
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,662
Not like that?
What's the difference?

525
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,537
At any rate, it's treachery
to sleep with the cops.

526
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:42,487
What did you say?

527
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:44,113
Nothing.
- Nothing?

528
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:47,421
But to eat food from the cops
is not treachery? What?

529
00:54:47,825 --> 00:54:49,356
Isn't it?

530
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:53,368
Do you also think that's treachery
to fuck with the cops?

531
00:54:54,652 --> 00:54:57,337
Yes, it is!
- You bitch!

532
00:55:04,932 --> 00:55:07,438
Here's to you, bitch!

533
00:55:07,996 --> 00:55:10,421
If you say it one more time,
I will kill you!

534
00:55:10,753 --> 00:55:12,394
Understood?

535
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:32,848
<i>NO ENTRY</i>

536
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:35,427
Careful!

537
00:55:52,774 --> 00:55:54,948
Aren't you afraid all alone?

538
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:56,647
What?

539
00:55:57,857 --> 00:56:00,348
Where do you live?

540
00:56:06,902 --> 00:56:09,242
There, through the park.

541
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,658
Do you want me to accompany you?

542
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,328
Hi, Dad!

543
00:56:23,165 --> 00:56:25,415
Finally!
- I'm sorry!

544
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,617
Should we accompany you
to the bus stop?

545
00:56:28,981 --> 00:56:30,624
No, it won't be necessary.
- Not?

546
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,825
Don't you know what's going on
here in the park?

547
00:56:36,673 --> 00:56:38,573
There's our one. Let's go!
- Wait a moment.

548
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:40,373
Hurry it up!

549
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,230
Yes?
- Hello. Chuma?

550
00:56:50,547 --> 00:56:52,619
Daddy!
- We'll take a break.

551
00:56:53,734 --> 00:56:55,216
Coming.

552
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:05,532
Well...

553
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,432
Sent a girl to hang around
at the station.

554
00:57:11,898 --> 00:57:13,463
Out of their minds, they are!

555
00:57:14,851 --> 00:57:18,412
I wouldn't let my children
out of my sight.

556
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:23,576
And if any creep approached them,
or even looked at them...

557
00:57:27,596 --> 00:57:29,086
I'd strangle him!

558
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,092
Want some more tea, Vika?

559
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:38,354
What...
No.

560
00:57:39,631 --> 00:57:41,737
So, spilled your hearts?

561
00:57:52,004 --> 00:57:54,800
Let's go!
- Grisha, don't be so cruel.

562
00:57:55,101 --> 00:57:57,096
Her underwear is still wet.

563
00:57:58,841 --> 00:58:01,623
She'll catch a cold,
and get sick.

564
00:58:01,852 --> 00:58:05,551
Cold, me? I've slept on a bench
in winter. I'll manage.

565
00:58:06,076 --> 00:58:08,732
She's a fighter.
Right?

566
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:22,424
Girls, what's taking you so long?
Soon the case will be dismissed.

567
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:24,608
Shall we party not?
- Of course we will.

568
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:28,341
Where is Hanin?
- Hanin!

569
00:58:28,975 --> 00:58:33,307
Hanin!

570
00:58:33,654 --> 00:58:35,600
Turn slightly to your left.

571
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:39,547
Put the right leg forward,
to the direction of the target,

572
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:41,988
So that the feet are
at shoulder width.

573
00:58:42,286 --> 00:58:44,046
The left arm hangs loosely
on the side.

574
00:58:44,768 --> 00:58:47,114
The right arm is stretched forward.

575
00:58:50,919 --> 00:58:55,736
You have to line up the upper end
of the sight with the target.

576
00:58:57,073 --> 00:59:04,425
Then, smoothly, without a jerk,
pull the trigger with the finger.

577
00:59:09,725 --> 00:59:12,282
Eyes are supposed to be open
when shooting, Chuma.

578
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,252
Hey, eagles!
- <i>What?</i>

579
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:33,998
Learn!
With the first shot.

580
00:59:34,097 --> 00:59:36,098
<i>Wow!
- Look at the teacher!</i>

581
00:59:37,197 --> 00:59:38,698
Well done!

582
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:41,768
Come, Vika. Let's go.
You'll be back in a minute.

583
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:44,208
I want to introduce you.
Come on!

584
00:59:46,068 --> 00:59:48,987
Girls!
Lara, Masha.

585
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:51,640
This is Vika.
- Pleased to meet you!

586
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,141
Well, socialise.

587
00:59:57,925 --> 00:59:59,495
Want to taste?

588
01:00:00,543 --> 01:00:02,115
I'm not hungry.

589
01:00:04,383 --> 01:00:06,373
Do you enjoy helping the guys?

590
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,856
They are helping me.

591
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:12,149
I am hunting.
Got it?

592
01:00:12,656 --> 01:00:15,349
Zaitsev!
- Finally! It's about time.

593
01:00:16,556 --> 01:00:18,249
An inspiration for a toast...

594
01:00:19,356 --> 01:00:20,849
...came to Prihodko.

595
01:00:21,783 --> 01:00:24,107
Vika! Champagne?

596
01:00:24,407 --> 01:00:26,362
No-no.
I'm to go to the park later today.

597
01:00:26,534 --> 01:00:32,953
Kolya, we know you since the first
days of work in the police force.

598
01:00:33,472 --> 01:00:39,108
And you are the only one of us,
who has remained... well...

599
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:41,463
who hasn't lost...
- <i>The Force.</i>

600
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,269
...his humaneness.

601
01:00:44,398 --> 01:00:48,788
The rest of us
have become cynics.

602
01:00:50,097 --> 01:00:51,639
To your health, Kolya!

603
01:00:55,325 --> 01:00:57,162
Happy birthday, bro!

604
01:00:59,025 --> 01:01:01,462
Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

605
01:01:21,979 --> 01:01:24,416
Dad said you live in a juvie.

606
01:01:26,524 --> 01:01:28,034
Well, I did.

607
01:01:28,658 --> 01:01:30,533
But now I'm living with Hanin.

608
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:34,958
...even myself, at one point.
- What? Really?

609
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,301
I think it's her.

610
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:39,502
Excuse me.

611
01:01:39,931 --> 01:01:41,402
<i>TATYANA
CALLING</i>

612
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:51,467
Lyosha!

613
01:01:52,694 --> 01:01:55,775
Look, I have to leave.

614
01:01:56,206 --> 01:01:57,837
You and Vlad,
you look after her, okay?

615
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:00,798
After the operation, take her
to the precinct.

616
01:02:01,115 --> 01:02:02,646
Let her sleep in my office.

617
01:02:03,192 --> 01:02:06,712
Fine.
But have you told her?

618
01:02:31,817 --> 01:02:33,369
Where is Hanin?

619
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,058
Chuma, he's off-duty today.

620
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:42,392
We will go to the police station,
and tomorrow he'll pick you up.

621
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:45,216
Where's Hanin?

622
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:48,393
Well, are we going to argue about
our relationship or enjoy the life?

623
01:03:49,096 --> 01:03:50,797
Is this what we're having
a relationship?

624
01:03:51,518 --> 01:03:53,011
Isn't it?

625
01:03:59,091 --> 01:04:00,550
Swine!

626
01:04:00,792 --> 01:04:03,636
You swine, you did not call me even once!
I waited like an idiot.

627
01:04:03,951 --> 01:04:08,107
Hands off!
Hands off!

628
01:04:45,821 --> 01:04:47,755
Why has she been
standing still for so long?

629
01:04:52,303 --> 01:04:53,986
Could be sitting on a bench.

630
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,628
She would haved pressed the button,
had anything happened.

631
01:05:03,278 --> 01:05:06,125
Strangely silent, too.
- Why don't you call her?

632
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:16,555
<i>This connection is unavailable.

01:05:16,793 --> 01:05:19,969
What the hell? Into the park!
Step on it!

634
01:05:40,475 --> 01:05:41,991
What's with the soup in the kitchen?

635
01:05:42,792 --> 01:05:44,208
What's with the clean-up?

636
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:48,313
Hanin, you've got yourself a bitch?

637
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,600
I thought I had
the wrong number.

638
01:05:57,701 --> 01:06:00,315
She's even answering the phone,
as if she was home!

639
01:06:00,687 --> 01:06:03,102
Hanin, you wouldn't let me
touch the telephone!

640
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:08,312
Maybe you've already
given her the keys?

641
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:12,239
Which days are hers?

642
01:06:23,669 --> 01:06:25,156
Here somewhere.

643
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,391
To the right!

644
01:06:29,932 --> 01:06:31,431
Can't you see anything?

645
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:34,079
I don't understand it.
- It must be near.

646
01:06:43,488 --> 01:06:45,574
Found it?
- Here!

647
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:52,910
Damn!

648
01:06:53,325 --> 01:06:55,957
Do you realise we had nowhere
to put her up?

649
01:06:59,865 --> 01:07:01,753
You're a shameless jerk!

650
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,455
Was that the best
you could make up?

651
01:07:15,504 --> 01:07:17,257
Tell you what?
I'm not going anywhere.

652
01:07:20,268 --> 01:07:22,361
I want to take a look at her.

653
01:07:22,617 --> 01:07:24,198
To see her.

654
01:07:24,814 --> 01:07:26,628
I'll sit down and stay here.

655
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:34,965
Yes?
- Something happened.

656
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:37,119
What is it?
- Chuma is nowhere to be found.

657
01:07:37,267 --> 01:07:40,544
The phone is switched off and the
transmitter we found under a tree.

658
01:07:41,146 --> 01:07:42,666
Maybe something happened.

659
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:45,090
I don't know.

660
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:47,340
What are we to do, Hanin?

661
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:56,790
<i>This connection is unavailable.
Leave a message...</i>

662
01:07:57,010 --> 01:07:58,590
Dammit!

663
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:06,366
All right, wait here if you want to.

664
01:08:06,897 --> 01:08:08,710
We'll talk when I get back.

665
01:08:11,037 --> 01:08:12,563
Suit yourself.

666
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:23,333
I don't know. Maybe he already strangled
her, and she didn't have a chance.

667
01:08:24,215 --> 01:08:26,188
Imbeciles!
Can't turn my back for a minute.

668
01:08:46,056 --> 01:08:48,963
Where are you anyway?
Oh, I'm seeing you already.

669
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:00,341
Go!

670
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:09,920
He's mine, is that clear?

671
01:09:11,158 --> 01:09:13,180
He promised to marry me.

672
01:09:13,987 --> 01:09:16,815
If you show your mug here ever again,
whore,

673
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:19,685
I'll cut your guts out.

674
01:09:19,885 --> 01:09:21,802
I can't hear you!

675
01:09:22,964 --> 01:09:26,697
What do I have to say?
- That you no longer exist!

676
01:09:27,868 --> 01:09:29,503
I don't exist.

677
01:09:31,164 --> 01:09:33,065
If you tell him about this,

678
01:09:33,237 --> 01:09:35,824
I'll wait you after work
and slice you.

679
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,911
I know where you work
and where you live.

680
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:40,939
Understood?
- Understood.

681
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:42,806
Get the fuck out of here!

682
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:25,105
Stop!

683
01:11:25,458 --> 01:11:27,635
You've been walking here
several evenings.  

684
01:11:27,958 --> 01:11:29,435
Hold it!

685
01:11:34,053 --> 01:11:35,891
Halt!

686
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:37,830
Stop or I'll shoot!

687
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:42,446
Back off!
You all right?

688
01:11:42,654 --> 01:11:44,159
Got him.

689
01:11:44,454 --> 01:11:45,959
Hold him.

690
01:11:46,154 --> 01:11:47,659
Up!

691
01:11:47,806 --> 01:11:50,202
Where did you put the transmitter?
- I just dropped it!

692
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,002
<i>Let's go, let's go!</i>

693
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:55,545
Idiot!
Into the car! Quickly!

694
01:12:03,072 --> 01:12:05,328
So you wanted to
make her acquaince?

695
01:12:10,584 --> 01:12:12,074
Yes.

696
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:17,193
I wanted to 
make her acquaintance.

697
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:21,191
I've been getting acquainted with girls
in the park.

698
01:12:21,492 --> 01:12:24,775
Were they all minors?

699
01:12:25,498 --> 01:12:28,779
I don't know.
I didn't check their ID's.

700
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,981
But I don't think
there were any minors.

701
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:33,059
Young, yes.

702
01:12:33,694 --> 01:12:35,700
I like young ones!

703
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:38,353
Not the old ones
with fat asses and cellulite!

704
01:12:38,695 --> 01:12:40,720
Strange, what?
- Easy now!

705
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,101
There, there.
Take it easy.

706
01:12:45,321 --> 01:12:48,677
After all, it's understandable.
Isn't it?

707
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:52,274
Where else to meet girls
if not in a park. Right?

708
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:55,419
And Petya, when you
get acquainted with a girl,

709
01:12:56,005 --> 01:12:58,279
you don't check her ID, do you?
- Absolutely not.

710
01:12:58,405 --> 01:13:00,649
I won't even glance at it.
- See.

711
01:13:01,382 --> 01:13:03,774
He didn't want to kill them.

712
01:13:04,019 --> 01:13:06,413
Did you?
- Of course not.

713
01:13:07,165 --> 01:13:08,702
And I didn't kill them.

714
01:13:08,953 --> 01:13:13,364
It's simply unpleasant
when they scream, what?

715
01:13:29,442 --> 01:13:31,496
You wanted her to shut up.

716
01:13:32,383 --> 01:13:33,885
Right, Bondaryev?

717
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:50,769
I didn't want to...

718
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:23,026
I put the soup into the fridge.
You'll manage on your own now.

719
01:14:24,475 --> 01:14:25,940
Wow. Woken up?

720
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:29,179
A tough case, you are.

721
01:14:29,809 --> 01:14:32,658
Two days with 40 degrees fever.
Here!

722
01:14:33,153 --> 01:14:35,069
Who's there?
- What?

723
01:14:36,741 --> 01:14:40,607
Feeling better?
You scared us all, Viktoriya.

724
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,520
I usually never get sick.
- But when you do, you do it properly.

725
01:14:45,023 --> 01:14:47,555
You'll be fine now.
I'm off to work.

726
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:49,588
Thanks, Lara!
- Thank you!

727
01:14:49,836 --> 01:14:51,388
So long!
- Goodbye!

728
01:14:53,127 --> 01:14:54,666
How's our pervert?

729
01:14:55,986 --> 01:14:57,727
The pervert turned out
to be difficult.

730
01:14:57,951 --> 01:14:59,649
Went into denial.
- Really?

731
01:14:59,835 --> 01:15:02,336
Keeps repeating the same thing:
business trip.

732
01:15:02,572 --> 01:15:04,834
Never mind. Our guys will
crack him in no time.

733
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:06,537
Have you read the newspaper?
- No.

734
01:15:06,667 --> 01:15:10,204
About time. The whole town in buzzing,
and you haven't seen it.

735
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:12,498
Look at this:

736
01:15:12,628 --> 01:15:14,935
<i>The strangling maniac from the park
has been caught.</i>

737
01:15:17,505 --> 01:15:20,852
<i>He turned out to be a modest
engineer of heating systems.</i>

738
01:15:22,176 --> 01:15:23,657
Hanin!

739
01:15:24,205 --> 01:15:26,390
Why didn't you send me
to a hospital?

740
01:15:28,178 --> 01:15:30,010
Give me the thermometer.

741
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,880
Here.

742
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:37,498
Give it to me!

743
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:41,156
36.5.
Well, that's better.

744
01:15:42,369 --> 01:15:43,984
Why's the face so happy?

745
01:15:45,925 --> 01:15:47,781
Got anything to eat?

746
01:15:50,698 --> 01:15:52,526
Getting well, aren't we?

747
01:15:52,813 --> 01:15:54,365
Cover yourself up.

748
01:16:01,414 --> 01:16:02,923
Just a little more
and he'll break.

749
01:16:03,014 --> 01:16:05,123
Where have you been?
It's getting cold.

750
01:16:06,283 --> 01:16:10,868
Look, why don't we confront him
with Chuma?

751
01:16:11,009 --> 01:16:15,874
By the way, how is she?
- By the way, better. Asked for food.

752
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:18,342
It's the same with dogs.
- What do you mean?

753
01:16:19,573 --> 01:16:22,219
I mean well.
- We'll get a male guest.

754
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:29,273
Timashov...
Yes, sir?

755
01:16:34,743 --> 01:16:36,264
Yes. Understood.

756
01:16:37,382 --> 01:16:39,796
Assault on a girl.
In an elevator in an apartment building.

757
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:41,586
Same profile.

758
01:16:44,196 --> 01:16:46,297
Apparently he entered
the elevator with her.

759
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:52,328
They went up to the last floor,
although she lives on the 6th.

760
01:16:54,073 --> 01:16:56,887
Petya, have you questioned everyone?
- Almost.

761
01:16:57,145 --> 01:17:00,559
There he took the stockings from her
and began to strangle her.

762
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:03,860
A neighbour came out smoking
and thought the boys were fooling around.

763
01:17:03,961 --> 01:17:06,036
He went to admonish them.
She got away.

764
01:17:06,165 --> 01:17:09,716
He caught her, threw her down
and then fled himself.

765
01:17:09,948 --> 01:17:12,117
How old is the child?
- 15.

766
01:17:12,916 --> 01:17:14,417
It could have been anyone.

767
01:17:14,862 --> 01:17:18,310
That stocking thing
was all over the newspapers.

768
01:17:18,657 --> 01:17:20,505
No, it's our guy.

769
01:17:20,827 --> 01:17:23,809
We scared him out of the park
and he moved to unfamiliar terrain.

770
01:18:33,617 --> 01:18:35,792
You won't catch him without me.

771
01:18:38,571 --> 01:18:41,942
You won't catch him without me!
- Enough, Vika!

772
01:18:42,589 --> 01:18:45,839
We tried.
Just don't cry or shout!

773
01:18:46,779 --> 01:18:48,291
Please.

774
01:18:48,842 --> 01:18:52,827
Pack your things and I'll take you back
to the juvie. You can't live here.

775
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:54,654
Why not?
- You just can't!

776
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:02,048
Don't kick me out.
I'm not a dog, I'm a human being.

777
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:06,075
Don't start a drama.
It's depressing enough without you.

778
01:19:07,996 --> 01:19:10,204
Why does it have to be today?
What not tomorrow?

779
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,300
Hanin!

780
01:19:16,009 --> 01:19:17,529
Kiss me!

781
01:19:18,013 --> 01:19:19,545
For goodbye.

782
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:27,690
Please, Hanin, kiss me!
Don't be a bastard!

783
01:20:08,263 --> 01:20:10,013
Going to her, aren't you?

784
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:12,154
The stinking crone?

785
01:20:13,907 --> 01:20:15,400
What are you talking about?

786
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:20,161
A pity I didn't slice her.

787
01:20:21,459 --> 01:20:24,872
But I'll kill her, got it?
If you marry her, I'll kill her!

788
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:28,283
Idiot!

789
01:20:57,337 --> 01:20:58,817
Chuma!

790
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:05,744
A nice girl!

791
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:08,929
Yes, she is.
- There's one just as nice.

792
01:21:09,385 --> 01:21:14,922
14, a pro. Those who have tried her
have come back for seconds.

793
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:19,936
Really?
- Don't worry. Her mother is also a pro.

794
01:21:20,388 --> 01:21:22,244
So there are no qualms.

795
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:25,870
So?
Shall we?

796
01:21:35,806 --> 01:21:37,682
I asked a small one.

797
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:51,372
What are you doing here?

798
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,195
What's happened to your neck?

799
01:21:57,963 --> 01:21:59,955
It's Tuesday, not Saturday.

800
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,439
Pour me a vodka.

801
01:22:03,862 --> 01:22:05,355
On account.

802
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:28,932
Hurry it up.

803
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,132
Come on!

804
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:58,866
That's it.
The first time he's shown himself.

805
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:00,611
Stop!

806
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:04,203
No, he's hiding his face.

807
01:23:05,161 --> 01:23:07,828
Well, these days only idiots
don't know about the cameras.

808
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:14,208
Kostya...

809
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:20,447
Your face is turning into jelly.

810
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:24,625
But from you,
only the trunk has remained.

811
01:23:30,058 --> 01:23:32,084
Let's fuck!

812
01:23:32,822 --> 01:23:34,374
Why fuck?

813
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:37,095
I love you, don't I?

814
01:23:37,943 --> 01:23:44,295
Then let's not.
If you love, you better not.

815
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:50,756
I, too, love a cop.

816
01:23:51,306 --> 01:23:52,812
More than my life.

817
01:23:55,036 --> 01:23:57,231
We even kissed, you know?

818
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:01,958
He's got a stubble
that is prickly.

819
01:24:02,904 --> 01:24:04,485
And his tongue...

820
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:07,151
has a bitter taste.

821
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:10,152
Maybe from the cigarettes.

822
01:24:12,251 --> 01:24:15,289
Anyway, I'll seriously
die without him, Kostya.

823
01:24:16,415 --> 01:24:19,319
Don't die, Vika.

824
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:22,434
You shouldn't die
because of a cop.

825
01:24:27,788 --> 01:24:29,204
Close your eyes!

826
01:24:29,364 --> 01:24:30,824
Did you?
- Yes.

827
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:32,707
What are you seeing?

828
01:24:33,015 --> 01:24:36,526
I see that we have a common elbow.
- Aha.

829
01:24:36,735 --> 01:24:38,427
One elbow for the two of us.

830
01:24:39,646 --> 01:24:42,353
I am pressing the elbow
against the ground.

831
01:24:43,195 --> 01:24:46,185
The earth is soft
and the elbow sinks in.

832
01:24:47,342 --> 01:24:49,799
From the ground
oozes warm water.

833
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,967
I dive into the warm mud.

834
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:59,572
From the reeds
appears your face.

835
01:25:03,615 --> 01:25:05,297
Without eyebrows.

836
01:25:07,782 --> 01:25:11,146
You smile,
and disappear.

837
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:19,046
And in your stead appears
a red train...

838
01:26:04,778 --> 01:26:06,408
Hi, Chuma!
- Hi.

839
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:09,687
I need a hand.
Hold this.

840
01:26:31,046 --> 01:26:33,806
Maybe you want to, like, come in?

841
01:26:39,082 --> 01:26:40,579
I'm off to the park.

842
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,019
I'll pick this up
in the morning.

843
01:26:48,082 --> 01:26:49,592
Chuma!

844
01:26:51,108 --> 01:26:54,928
Maybe I should, like,
come with you?

845
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,303
Chuma!

846
01:29:01,137 --> 01:29:04,576
Hi there! I thought they took you
back to the juvie.

847
01:29:05,861 --> 01:29:07,322
They did.

848
01:29:08,353 --> 01:29:10,053
Will you let me in
to warm up?

849
01:29:10,315 --> 01:29:11,800
Of course. Come on in.

850
01:29:29,665 --> 01:29:33,225
Hanin.
- Hanin, this is Dektyar from the 32nd.

851
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,207
A chap here had his
Mercedes stolen.

852
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:39,666
What's that got to do with me?
- He was living in that house

853
01:29:39,823 --> 01:29:41,462
where the girl was strangled,
remember?

854
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:43,569
He feared for the car.
Put up a camera.

855
01:29:43,617 --> 01:29:47,008
I didn't help him, but it did help us.
The maniac showed himself.

856
01:29:47,330 --> 01:29:49,754
Just catch him.
The photo is ID quality.

857
01:29:54,568 --> 01:29:56,059
I'm doing everything for him.

858
01:29:57,139 --> 01:29:58,868
If you feel that way about a person,

859
01:29:58,969 --> 01:30:00,998
you think he'll feel
the same about you.

860
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,473
But he's such a pig.
Hasn't even called once.

861
01:30:05,630 --> 01:30:08,193
Yes, that's what Hanin's like.
- Yeah.

862
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:12,348
So you're walking all alone now?
Without a transmitter? Without an alarm?

863
01:30:12,545 --> 01:30:14,001
Yes.

864
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:17,158
Thankfully, they at least
left me this shirt.

865
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:44,382
Seryozhaant Motorin speaking.
- This is Hanin.

866
01:30:45,383 --> 01:30:46,826
Tell me, is Tolya off-duty today?

867
01:30:47,053 --> 01:30:48,570
Just got relieved.

868
01:30:48,994 --> 01:30:53,227
That Chuma of yours
came to visit him.

869
01:30:53,587 --> 01:30:55,318
They left together.
- What time?

870
01:30:55,549 --> 01:30:57,396
About 15 minutes ago.

871
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,896
Prihodko, where are you?
Get everyone together.

872
01:31:30,997 --> 01:31:32,413
Comb the entire park!

873
01:31:35,752 --> 01:31:38,455
Go faster! Faster!

874
01:31:46,116 --> 01:31:49,609
Step on it!

875
01:31:50,647 --> 01:31:54,510
Igor, your people will go from the right.
Kostya, from the left. Get a move on!

876
01:32:01,164 --> 01:32:02,922
Faster!

877
01:32:22,112 --> 01:32:25,962
Are you all right?
Vika, are you all right?

878
01:32:26,104 --> 01:32:28,061
Are you injured?
Vika!

879
01:32:28,379 --> 01:32:30,321
Where is he?

880
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:05,176
5 cm higher
and you would have killed him.

881
01:33:14,126 --> 01:33:18,346
<i>...Move aside, you cannot stand here.
Come on, come on, faster...</i>

882
01:33:40,726 --> 01:33:42,346
I quit.

883
01:33:58,526 --> 01:34:07,446
<i>An unfamiliar star is shining,
again we are separated from the home.</i>

884
01:34:07,726 --> 01:34:17,146
<i>Again there are cities between us,
the groundlights of an airport.</i>

885
01:34:17,426 --> 01:34:26,746
<i>Here we have fogs and rains,
here we have cold dawns.</i>

886
01:34:27,326 --> 01:34:38,246
<i>Here, on an unexplored path,
complicated plots are waiting.</i>

887
01:34:38,526 --> 01:34:48,246
<i>Hope is my compass,
and luck is a reward for bravery.</i>

888
01:34:48,526 --> 01:35:00,346
<i>But one song is enough,
as long as it's about home.</i>

889
01:35:16,698 --> 01:35:18,148
I'm going to see our people.

890
01:35:21,268 --> 01:35:23,053
Return home by 21:00!

891
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:32,353
<i>Swallow, don't sit on the gate,
you will break your black wings.</i>

892
01:35:32,668 --> 01:35:39,653
<i>My gate has sharp stakes.
I know it myself.</i>

893
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:45,053
<i>Sweetie, don't fly under my window,</i>

894
01:35:45,368 --> 01:35:49,353
<i>don't tease me,
it's painful enough as it is.</i>

895
01:35:49,568 --> 01:35:56,353
<i>I'd like to fly with you as a bird
into the freedom.</i>

896
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:04,653
<i>Into the freedom...</i>

897
01:36:05,668 --> 01:36:08,253
<i>Lyosha, drop in for a moment!
- Okay!</i>

898
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:11,293
Wow, look who's come!

899
01:36:12,052 --> 01:36:14,299
Hello, Chuma, friend!
- Hi, Vitya!

900
01:36:14,492 --> 01:36:16,939
Look who's here!
- Wake up, cop!

901
01:36:17,587 --> 01:36:19,098
Greetings, jailbirds!

902
01:36:20,637 --> 01:36:22,107
Hi, Vika!
- Hi.

903
01:36:22,266 --> 01:36:24,008
How are you?
- Excellent.

904
01:36:24,823 --> 01:36:28,330
Look at this!
Is this not proof?

905
01:36:28,844 --> 01:36:31,124
Why do you waste your energy?
Everything is clear:

906
01:36:31,897 --> 01:36:34,302
The witnesses have been bribed
or intimidated. Right?

907
01:36:34,402 --> 01:36:35,950
It's pointless to press him.

908
01:36:36,154 --> 01:36:39,289
Hello!
- Oh, look at who's here!

909
01:36:39,454 --> 01:36:41,889
That's all. Take him away.
- <i>Well, come in then.</i>

910
01:36:42,021 --> 01:36:44,552
Hello!
- Hello, assassin!

911
01:36:44,821 --> 01:36:46,452
<i>Yes.
Yes, this is Hanin.</i>

912
01:36:47,599 --> 01:36:49,073
<i>Oh yes...
Wait a moment.</i>

913
01:36:49,174 --> 01:36:50,666
Hello!
- Hello.

914
01:36:50,830 --> 01:36:53,420
What do you want?
- I came to talk about work.

915
01:36:53,652 --> 01:36:55,223
With me?
- Yes.

916
01:36:56,589 --> 01:36:58,261
Look, let's make it Wednesday, okay?

917
01:36:58,595 --> 01:37:01,947
Or next week. Sorry, I'm drowning in work.
Call me, okay?

918
01:37:02,148 --> 01:37:03,991
Yes. Yes, I'm on my way.

919
01:37:04,148 --> 01:37:05,691
Well?

920
01:37:26,898 --> 01:37:28,320
Want some tea?

921
01:37:30,498 --> 01:37:33,620
Come on, let's hear it!
Come on!

922
01:37:34,767 --> 01:37:36,893
Well...
- Well?

923
01:37:37,003 --> 01:37:38,843
I saw it on TV yesterday...
- Right.

924
01:37:39,174 --> 01:37:40,991
...about a sect.
- Yes?

925
01:37:41,202 --> 01:37:43,496
There's that dude who is
bullshitting people.

926
01:37:43,731 --> 01:37:46,247
People believed him,
gave his all their money,

927
01:37:46,410 --> 01:37:48,688
and joined the sect.
I have a plan:

928
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:51,289
I'll join the sect,
pretending that I believe.

929
01:37:51,424 --> 01:37:53,907
I will find everything out
and bring you the evidence.

930
01:37:54,032 --> 01:37:56,063
After all, I'm not easy to fool
as you know.

931
01:37:56,305 --> 01:37:57,977
Vika!
- What?

932
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:01,077
Why don't you finish school first?
You've got two years to go.

933
01:38:01,319 --> 01:38:03,999
Petya, Kolya! We found it!
- Just a moment.

934
01:38:04,569 --> 01:38:06,271
Coming!
No offence, Vika.

935
01:38:07,001 --> 01:38:09,495
As soon as a new maniac appears,
we'll come to you.

936
01:38:09,728 --> 01:38:11,276
Here, have a baranka.

937
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:13,929
But...
- <i>What did you find?</i>

938
01:38:14,128 --> 01:38:16,029
<i>Here, look...</i>

939
01:38:19,128 --> 01:38:20,629
<i>Well, let's give it a try.</i>

940
01:38:23,628 --> 01:38:25,929
Lena, dear...
- Yes?

941
01:39:24,628 --> 01:39:29,329
<i>All right guys, I'm going.
- See you.</i>

942
01:41:07,725 --> 01:41:09,807
<i>What time tomorrow?
- At six.</i>

943
01:41:10,025 --> 01:41:11,507
<i>At six? All right.</i>

944
01:41:11,825 --> 01:41:14,807
<i>Just don't be late, please.
- Fine. See you!</i>

945
01:42:13,025 --> 01:42:15,107
Why are you roaming in the darkness?

946
01:42:15,528 --> 01:42:17,130
Tired of living?

947
01:42:39,294 --> 01:42:41,799
What do you want?
- May I walk with you?
