Subtitles made by RussianSubMaker

2
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:33,000
What’s with these dumb topics,
like “who’s bigger, is cooler?

3
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,968
Survival of the fittest, or what? Scared?
Not scared. How long?

4
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:41,000
Here

5
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:44,000
You think I didn’t see when we were swimming?

6
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,000
<u>Here
Last one there’s a smelly carpenter</u>

7
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,100
(song): Out of boredom, learn lessons,

8
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:06,940
Today we’re not up for them.

9
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,980
Cosmos in the chest, baby,

10
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,990
The hertz of the heart exploded…

11
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:28,000
Между нами импульс тока...
Between us, an electric current impulse...

12
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:33,000
Why’s our door open?

13
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:36,000
Look

14
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:39,000
Looks like someone’s on our roof

15
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,000
We should probably get her down

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait. She’s gonna flip over and flash her tits. Just watch

17
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:02,000
Sure

18
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,000
That one’s [amazing]
For sure! What’re you talking about?

19
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,000
I’m telling you! I can see it from here

20
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:21,000
Have you lost it?

21
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:24,000
Have you lost it?

22
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:26,000
Who would stare at you? Who even needs you,
you big-eared thing?

23
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:30,000
Are you dumb?

24
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:33,534
You’re lucky I don’t hit people with crooked legs

25
00:02:34,986 --> 00:02:36,542
Let him go!
Take your hands off!

26
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:39,156
Say it! Zhenya excuse the dumbass

27
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:42,029
Go to hell! Asshole

28
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,047
Just try

29
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,115
It’s from East Germany.
And he’s from the USSR. Let him go!

30
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,342
He should apologize first

31
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,533
Быстро извинись, засранец.
Да пошла ты!

32
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:52,515
Wait!

33
00:02:57,015 --> 00:02:58,999
This roof is for those who live here!

34
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,506
We moved here last week, got it?

35
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:03,410
So what? Get lost

36
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:04,562
Hey San'

37
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,125
You leave, or was that not enough?

38
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:12,620
Damn, Ilyukh, who did this to you?
Tsigan's [Gypsy’s] gang

39
00:03:16,088 --> 00:03:18,000
There’s a letter for you

40
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:22,000
Damn it.
But we don’t go to their neighborhood anymore

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,554
They took my cat hostage
Said if we don’t bring the cash

42
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:28,000
That they will shit on her

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let them, we’ll never save up for the boat at this rate

44
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:33,000
Give me my share
I’ll go handle it myself

45
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:36,363
Are you serious?
You pay to walk around?

46
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,046
Yes.
Who’s that?

47
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,975
Nobody. Why you listening in?

Go keep sunbathing

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,827
Go on, keep sunbathing

49
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:43,641
Listen here

50
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,936
Careful
What careful?

51
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:50,215
Starting tomorrow, pay me for the roof

52
00:03:50,342 --> 00:03:52,210
Buzz off

53
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:56,043
We need to pay them the money

54
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,413
Yeah, so they can see us as losers for the rest of our lives.
I’m fed up with it

55
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,000
Got a different plan?
Yes, I do

56
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:04,879
I’ll hit Tsigan.
One punch, and he’ll never come back

57
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:08,000
They’ll catch us one by one, and that’s it.
We need a compromise

58
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,811
Just say you’re scared.
Let’s go, Ilyukh, get your cat

59
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:45,000
Why’re you tagging along like a little dog?

60
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:47,000
I just want to watch them beat you up

61
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey

62
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:59,000
Just go home

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There are real thugs there.
I’ll handle it without you

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know why she followed us?
She’s into me

65
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,293
Really?

66
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:09,986
I’m telling you, when she twisted my arm,
I felt her chest with my back

67
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:15,846
Where are you from?

68
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,728
We moved from Kazakhstan

69
00:05:19,016 --> 00:05:22,000
Cool.
What’s the mortality rate over there?

70
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:25,000
Haven’t checked
We’ve got a high death rate

71
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:33,007
Make it not too strong, you know, for the first time

72
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,000
Stop playing around.
Acting like a fag

73
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:39,000
Dad said, two bags per glass of water

74
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:41,195
That’s how we’ll do it

75
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,407
Tsigan

76
00:05:46,008 --> 00:05:48,000
Guys, wait, I’ll be right back

77
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:53,569
Hey, brothers! Want to drink some chifir [strong tea] with us?

78
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,398
No, no, thank you

79
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:56,754
Why not?

80
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:00,923
A decent guy offers you a drink, and you’re acting like you’re too good for us?

81
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,097
No, you got it wrong

82
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,834
What do you mean, I misunderstood?
Are you calling me stupid?

83
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:11,000
Hold up, Koschei.
Let him speak

84
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,802
So, I brought the cash, just like you asked

85
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,007
What? I asked?

86
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,687
So, you think I’m an extortionist?

87
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:30,007
Are you accusing me?

88
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:34,019
I made the decision myself.
Alright, go ahead, since it’s your choice.

89
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:37,206
Like, he came in here throwing accusations

90
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:43,999
How much?
A thousand

91
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:47,000
Actually, it was fifteen hundred.
He pocketed five hundred, I saw it

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What? How about I empty my pockets right now, and if there’s nothing, I’ll punch you in the face

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,403
Deal?

94
00:06:52,008 --> 00:06:53,064
I saw it too

95
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,309
Saw what, exactly?

96
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:56,211
Quiet, quiet

97
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,000
The guys are dealing fair, right?
Right

98
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:03,621
Can I take the cat?
What?

99
00:07:04,528 --> 00:07:07,452
Can I take the cat?
A cat? This one?

100
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:11,047
Yeah.
Well, dance.

101
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:12,649
Leave him alone, he can’t dance

102
00:07:12,743 --> 00:07:14,410
Hey, was anybody asking you there?

103
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,482
Dance!

104
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:21,000
Op op

105
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,975
Fifteen hundred is for three

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But there are four of you.
Look, there’s a chick with you

107
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:31,926
Her? She’s not with us

108
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,447
Not with you?

109
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:34,797
Well then, sit with us, yeah?

110
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,355
Hey, redhead, come here

111
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:42,232
No need.
Don’t be scared, bro! We’re nice guys

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,546
What are you standing there for? I said come here!

113
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,944
Wait a second.
What’s your problem, huh?

114
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:48,518
Hey, what are you doing, idiot?

115
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,915
What, feeling brave, six against two?

116
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,182
I could take all of you one-on-one...

117
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,193
Well?

118
00:07:58,056 --> 00:07:59,016
Tsigan

119
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,823
(shouting)

120
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,606
You bastard! You ruined the chifir, you bitch!

121
00:08:08,027 --> 00:08:11,647
(music playing): Alone again,
awake at night, flipping through my past

122
00:08:11,765 --> 00:08:16,508
Above me, the voice of the night
circles in the air, unhidden

123
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:20,067
This is all because of you and your stupid cat

124
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:21,879
(song playing): My
precious, my pain,

125
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:25,358
my precious, I’m yours, only
heaven knows how much I love you

126
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:28,294
My precious, my life,
my precious, I’m yours...

127
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,705
What?
Suck my ass, you fools!

128
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,000
Жень

129
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,008
Open the door

130
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:08,435
Open the door, I said!

131
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:11,870
Come out, don’t be scared! We won’t
touch you!

132
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:17,000
Girl, hey girl? Let’s go

133
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,992
Bro, I said, open the door

134
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:26,000
Come on out, schoolkids! Hey, we’re gonna
tip over your car! Come out

135
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:30,839
Come out, I said!

136
00:09:31,983 --> 00:09:34,547
Wait, wait, wait!

137
00:09:36,357 --> 00:09:38,285
Yeah

138
00:09:48,995 --> 00:09:50,991
Where did you learn to drive?

139
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:54,000
Well, my granddad taught me once

140
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, I think we’ve lost them

141
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:02,000
You’re not as much of a fool as you seem at
the first glance

142
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,015
Thanks

143
00:10:15,024 --> 00:10:17,000
Iluh,

144
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:20,605
They killed your cat

145
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:25,796
No, she was already dead.
I was taking her to bury her

146
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:32,000
You know who you are?
Ilyusha

147
00:10:34,056 --> 00:10:35,806
A big one!

148
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,857
Listen, how about we drive to my place?

149
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:43,000
Okay, let’s go

150
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,514
(music playing)
Oh, Doctor Alban

151
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:04,136
Stop, fridge, stop, freezer...

152
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:10,000
(singing): It’s my life...

153
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:13,529
It’s my love, my life

154
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:16,023
My life

155
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:31,505
(mom talking on the phone off-screen): I’m telling you,
no, in '62 the pipe burst

156
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:34,000
Well, then hurry up and leave

157
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:38,000
What am I supposed to do with your bronchitis?
The hot water’s leaking, you’ll breathe in some steam too.

158
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:42,257
What, another accident?
Yep

159
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,000
That's it

160
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:46,000
Nadusha, we agreed,
no smoking in the house, it’s harmful

161
00:12:46,096 --> 00:12:48,000
Listen, Fedya, that’s not proven

162
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:55,000
Fifteen years ago

163
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,682
Your dad sent me a picture of himself on a donkey

164
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:00,992
With the caption: "I’m the one on top."

165
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:04,000
Thanks to this wonderful little clarification

166
00:13:04,092 --> 00:13:07,000
Our happy family was born

167
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,983
Fedya, thank you so much

168
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:14,324
Happy holiday!
Happy holiday!

169
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,480
Happy holiday!

170
00:13:23,084 --> 00:13:26,000
Dad, mom, I also have a gift for you

171
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay, let’s see.
Let’s see

172
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:33,585
Fedya, I also have a gift for you

173
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:34,469
Really?

174
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,904
Raya died

175
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,000
Who?

176
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Dummy. Raya, on the left, remember? The woman
who sold lingerie at the market

177
00:13:47,052 --> 00:13:50,703
I made an arrangement with Vitalik,
You’re going on Saturday

178
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:56,000
Me?
At the market, selling

179
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,007
Fedya, you have no idea, this is a real chance

180
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:03,967
I made twice as much
this weekend as I did in half a year

181
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:05,034
At the housing and utilities.

182
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:06,741
Song!

183
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,000
Were whiter than snow

184
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,879
Wedding flowers

185
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,998
This is humiliating

186
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:19,016
Fedya, your salary is like five of these chickens,
and honestly, that’s humiliating

187
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:25,007
Nadush...

188
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,762
We’ll earn twice as much,
just the two of us

189
00:14:28,004 --> 00:14:31,000
Please, I ask you, I’ve already arranged everything

190
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,442
(singing): Wedding flowers
still live within me

191
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,418
Mom, dad, happy wedding anniversary

192
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:43,000
Come on, bunny

193
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,000
Nadya, about the market...

194
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:49,490
I am not going

195
00:14:51,988 --> 00:14:53,612
Hooray!

196
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:07,857
Why are you sitting?

197
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:12,981
Look at yourself, what a scarecrow you've become.
What’s that on your face?

198
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,882
Seriously, can’t you just get rid of all this?

199
00:15:17,849 --> 00:15:19,873
Wait,
What’s that?

200
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:20,826
Tripped.
What?

201
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:26,563
And this is how you tripped?

202
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,044
Alexander, Ryabinins don't lie

203
00:15:37,044 --> 00:15:39,000
Just don’t be angry

204
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:43,833
Well, well, well

205
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:47,975
It’s nothing

206
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,065
It’ll heal by the wedding

207
00:15:50,096 --> 00:15:53,000
Alright, we leave Vika
at home, and now we go to the police, okay?

208
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:58,065
Why rush, maybe no one
even saw him?

209
00:15:58,232 --> 00:15:59,765
Did anyone see you?

210
00:16:01,032 --> 00:16:03,000
Listen, what difference does it make if anyone
saw him or not

211
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:05,000
You see, you have a son who’s a thief

212
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:08,000
And he should take responsibility
for his actions, understood?

213
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,455
Mom.
Mom..., I’m going to mom you now, mom

214
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:17,008
If they give him a real sentence, they’ll send
him to a juvenile detention center

215
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,975
Listen, what are you talking about?
They won’t send him, understood?

216
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Spit it out
Let’s go

217
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,061
Let’s go

218
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:28,205
Maybe we should call your brother?
We’ll ask for advice

219
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:31,432
I’ll call my brother right now.
I’ll call him right now

220
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:35,000
The prison is crying for him, for my brother
Why are you sitting down?

221
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,655
Let’s go!
Fedya, where are you going?

222
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:42,000
Uh...

223
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:45,000
My stomach hurts a bit

224
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Fedya, we’re waiting for you downstairs.
Ah

225
00:16:51,016 --> 00:16:54,000
So, who was the mastermind behind the hijacking?

226
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:57,000
Me
Accomplices?

227
00:16:58,052 --> 00:17:01,000
Lastnames?
Names, Nicknames?

228
00:17:01,068 --> 00:17:03,000
No, I was alone

229
00:17:04,052 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you sure?

230
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,000
According to witnesses, there were two teenagers
in the car

231
00:17:09,306 --> 00:17:11,222
Sasha, I don’t understand who you’re protecting

232
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:15,000
I’m telling you, I was alone

233
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,000
The car owner has shown up
Very good

234
00:17:20,028 --> 00:17:22,000
Let him wait in the hall for now

235
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:27,000
So what’s the deal?

236
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:31,000
Zurab Otarovich?

237
00:17:35,006 --> 00:17:37,000
He’s going to die

238
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:46,000
If you don’t water him, he’ll die

239
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:50,253
Yes, sir,
we’ll keep an eye on it

240
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,114
Wait,
where are you going?
Fedya!

241
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Wait,
what’s going on here?

242
00:18:03,043 --> 00:18:06,561
Where’s that faggot
Hey, you piece of shit,
sit down!

243
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:09,000
Do you know whose car you stole?

244
00:18:09,126 --> 00:18:12,118
I will fuck you, then will fry your ears and eat them

245
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,739
I stole it.
What?

246
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:16,732
Sasha!
Timur

247
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:21,927
Excuse him.
Timur really loved that car

248
00:18:24,048 --> 00:18:26,000
I have a grandson,Khryzon

249
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,182
want to leave him a city

250
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:33,437
without thieves.
You know...
You know, we deeply

251
00:18:34,008 --> 00:18:36,266
regret what happened

252
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,809
Your son?

253
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:42,000
This is my son

254
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,488
And mine

255
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,698
He is ours

256
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:47,975
Your son destroyed

257
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,590
my nephew's car

258
00:18:49,673 --> 00:18:51,891
Now you have to buy him a new one

259
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:53,673
And there was money under the seat. Ten grand

260
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:56,771
I didn’t take any money

261
00:18:57,028 --> 00:18:59,398
He broke the car,
but he didn’t take the money

262
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:01,940
No,no, he didn’t take the money

263
00:19:01,979 --> 00:19:03,751
You heard him, he said...

264
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,426
The money needs to be returned

265
00:19:06,004 --> 00:19:09,558
How can we return it?
We don’t have that kind of money

266
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:14,000
Sell the apartment.
Borrow

267
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:16,114
The deadline is in a week

268
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,510
Later, for every overdue
day, I’ll cut off one of his fingers.

269
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:28,490
I can always be found at the "Caucasus" restaurant.

270
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,000
Wait.
Please, wait.

271
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,840
Sorry...
Excuse me.

272
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,780
Who, who are these people?

273
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,680
What people?

274
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,240
I didn’t see anyone.

275
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,000
How?

276
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,000
Don’t make fools
out of us.

277
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,170
Wait, are you mocking us?

278
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,000
You saw it, just now
there were people here.

279
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,050
They, you know, they threatened him.

280
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,870
They threatened my child.

281
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,630
They said they would cut him
off every day.

282
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,350
We will sue you.

283
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,570
Please, calm down.

284
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,290
Your case is closed.

285
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,460
The Kamaz driver wrote that he crashed into
a pole.

286
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,210
And the BMW owner has no claims.
You are free to go.

287
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,550
How?

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,660
Nadya, I’m sure everything will be fine.

289
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,000
Sasha, just don’t worry, we’re changing the toilet for the former colonel

290
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,370
of the militia...

291
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,990
Is that Uncle Alyk here?

292
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,470
Well, hello, Zurab.

293
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,020
Afghan?

294
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,000
You shouldn’t have stopped. Start the engine.

295
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Don’t rush.
They say your car got smashed?

296
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,510
How do you know?
Afghans have eyes everywhere.

297
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,170
Let me fix it—
no questions asked.

298
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,480
Fix it.
But what about the money?

299
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,990
Ten thousand bucks disappeared from the car.

300
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,030
Small change, Zurab.
What about a hundred?

301
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,810
Not a lime.
I personally didn’t see that money.

302
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,000
Your word
against mine?

303
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,000
Anyway, Zurab,
I'll fix the car, but the money...

304
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,000
I respect your word.
But there’s no evidence.

305
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,000
Sorry.

306
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,030
As you wish.

307
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You won’t give it—I’ll ask them.

308
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,000
Did you call him after all?

309
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,620
What, Nadya, how could I?
It’s just a lucky coincidence.

310
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,530
Sancho, you’re something else, nephew.

311
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,930
What are you even doing?

312
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:59,000
What do you need?
Me? Nothing.

313
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,340
I talked with the chebureks, made the deal for you
with the car.

314
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,970
What about?
I’ll fix their car, and everything will be fine.

315
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,130
We don’t need your help.

316
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,270
Oh, really?
Yes.

317
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,770
Oh, what have I done! Zurab Jan, let’s rewind everything.

318
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,820
It’s not funny at all, understood?

319
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Come on, smile, sis.

320
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You already have wrinkles.
Dumbass

321
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Friends, how about coming to our place?

322
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,820
We’ll have some tea, eat some chicken legs.

323
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And in the end, Ali has not been
here for a long time.

324
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,000
How much do we owe you?

325
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
One thank you will be enough.
Thank you.

326
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,150
We don’t need gangster money.
We’re an honest family with a reputation.

327
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,000
And we won’t owe anything
to people like him. How much?

328
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,250
A thousand bucks.
Ups.

329
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:00,990
Nadya.

330
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,000
I’ll pay everything.
With a receipt.

331
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,570
Give me the passport number and don’t forget
the stamp.

332
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,970
You...
just unbelievable.

333
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,490
Where are you going?
You’ll send it by mail.

334
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,000
Sancho, Uncle Fyodor, hold on.

335
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,130
Don’t you want to visit your father?

336
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,040
(music playing)

337
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,160
So, what’s up?

338
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,480
Mommy, this is my piggy bank.

339
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,450
My sunshine, of course,
it’s your piggy bank.

340
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,990
But you see, right now we’re in a very
complicated economic situation in the family.

341
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,860
And for this, you should thank your brother.

342
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,890
Here’s your brother, say thank you.

343
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,890
And also, my sunshine, we really need
some money.

344
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,950
But your dad, for some reason, just doesn’t want to.
He doesn’t want to make money.

345
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,160
Well, because he’s very proud.

346
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,000
And he has his favorite thing to do.

347
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,260
And all the dirty, hard work is done by
mommy,

348
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,990
my sunshine! Right.

349
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,990
What do we have here?
Let’s see.

350
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,240
Aha.
Earrings, do you like the earrings?

351
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,370
Nice earrings.
Look, I like them too.

352
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,310
We’ll have to sell them.
Do you like the bracelet?

353
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,000
I like it too.
I also like this bracelet.

354
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,000
We’ll have to sell it too.

355
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,000
And the grandfather’s medal too, of course,
we’ll have to sell it.

356
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,080
We’ll have to sell all of this.

357
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,650
My sunshine,
forgive me, please, okay?

358
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:08,590
It’s okay, it’s okay, don’t cry, come here.

359
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Nadya.

360
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I’ll go with you to the market to work.

361
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,760
(song playing): The rebellious spirit,
Pandora’s dream

362
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,840
Poisoned arrows.

363
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,130
A fire in the chest
Couldn’t

364
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,710
Destroy the spell...

365
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,610
You’ll take this, and he’s under house
arrest.

366
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,000
Mom, why just a little pancake?

367
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,170
Eat, bunny.
Okay, go ahead.

368
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,090
Have a good day.
Goodbye.

369
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,180
Here, take it, I don’t
want it.

370
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,420
Dad.
Well?

371
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,070
Let me take the receipt myself.

372
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,060
You don’t need to get involved in this, San.

373
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:36,670
You shouldn’t have gotten in the car, and
gone under the bridge.

374
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,940
Yeah.

375
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,900
I shouldn’t have.

376
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,600
Hello, Baba Manya, Baba Tonya.

377
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,990
(song playing): Drunken stars burned,

378
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,930
Bullets sang, blood poured.

379
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,210
They died for fun,

380
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,680
Resurrected, fought again...

381
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,320
Come on, come on, let’s go.

382
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,000
That’s it.

383
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,610
No more flirting with the salesgirls at the market, understood?

384
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,990
That’s it, hook,
only for a month.

385
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,260
You’re kind, Oleg, I would’ve shot his balls for that.

386
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,020
What?
Go.

387
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,000
You’re so ruthless.

388
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,000
Alick. Alick.

389
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,620
Commander, damn! Some kid just
got here, says he’s your nephew.

390
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,000
Didn’t get it.
Do you have a nephew?

391
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I’m seeing him for the first time.

392
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
San, confirm it.

393
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,000
Maybe there’s something I don’t know about you?

394
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,020
Maybe you have a wife?

395
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Yeah, I’m a eunuch.

396
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I was, until I met you.

397
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:11,170
Sancho, you’re a saboteur.

398
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,000
Sorry, I didn’t mean to.

399
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
You’re free.
What?

400
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,030
Aah..Yes!

401
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,880
Lift up your jacket, my arms can’t bend.

402
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,000
Yuri...
Close the door.

403
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,460
Good news.

404
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,580
The fifth and sixth chapters of my novel
are ready.

405
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,160
Do you remember, I gave you to read?

406
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,190
I don’t remember, but can you still
show it to your publisher friend?

407
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:31,000
I really need the money.
It’s such a lively story.

408
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,000
I would thank you from the advance.

409
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:38,980
I’ll wash my hands. It’s okay, I’ll reprint it again.

410
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,690
Fedya, I don’t need an opus about Ivan
Sergeyevich. Do you understand or not?

411
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,530
Ah, so you’ve read it. Well, how did you like it?

412
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,390
Honestly?
Yeah.

413
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,450
Here.

414
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,490
So what! He writes shitty poems himself.

415
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,790
Fedya, I hear everything.

416
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,580
This is how we do it...
Understood.

417
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:21,410
Let’s toast to the meeting.
Here, the guys from Astrakhan sent this.

418
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,780
Come on, come on, come on! You don’t know how to live beautifully.

419
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,000
Bye.
I also hate this caviar.

420
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:40,800
Donald!
Sanyok, do you have a girlfriend?

421
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,110
No.
It’s fixable.

422
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,010
Yeah, he has everything.

423
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,640
He stole a car for her.

424
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,400
Mmm, how cool.

425
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,320
Nobody stole a car for me.

426
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,640
Hey, hello.

427
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Vitek, it suits you.

428
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,000
So, Vitek,

429
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,560
do you like it when they grab your ass?

430
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,730
Uncle Alik,

431
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,360
take me with you.
I have to work off this debt myself.

432
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,000
What?
You want to live like this?

433
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:30,460
Yes, I’m ready to do anything.

434
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,150
Just not criminal stuff.

435
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,040
Don’t worry, we’ve already killed Zurab.

436
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,040
So your family thinks this about me too, right?

437
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,140
I don’t think so.

438
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,030
Here’s a letter from my mom.

439
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,340
I’ll work it off myself.

440
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,970
Come on, Sancho,
go home.

441
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,840
Chew gum, drink soda, live life to the fullest,
while I’m alive, I’ll protect you.

442
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,670
Don’t rush to grow up.

443
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,970
No, I...

444
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I want to do it myself.
I’m ready to sweep courtyards, wash cars.

445
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,000
Anything.

446
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,670
Go home, or your proper
mom will yell at you.

447
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,350
So, kid,
time to go home?

448
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I don’t need your gum.
Come on, come on.

449
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,980
Fedor Ivanovich,
I’m here again.

450
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,760
You didn’t submit the Life of Archpriest Avvakum.

451
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,000
I don’t have any life story.

452
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,000
Lost it?

453
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,140
Well, look for it more.
I’ll come back to you tomorrow.

454
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,140
Uh-huh.
If you don’t find it, it’s not a big deal.

455
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,000
I’ll mark it as worn out.

456
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,990
Fedor Ivanovich, something happened?
To me?

457
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:35,000
No. No, everything’s fine.

458
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,000
I just thought I was a writer.

459
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,600
Turns out I’m just
an ordinary hack.

460
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,460
And my place is in the market.

461
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,840
What are you saying?
It can’t be that,

462
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,090
that a person with such
a love for literature as you

463
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,970
writes badly.
You...

464
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
haven’t read it.
So let me read it.

465
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,790
I’ll honestly, impartially

466
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,030
tell you how talented you are.

467
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,000
Yes. Let's do it.

468
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,100
Thank you, Tatyana.
You can just call me Tanya.

469
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,000
Tanya.

470
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,000
Sorry, what do you need?

471
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Maybe I can do something?

472
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
I want to make up for my screw-up in front of Uncle Alik.

473
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,000
You need to, you make up for it.

474
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Please, I'll do anything.

475
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,000
Listen, do you see the Shishik parked there?

476
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,970
What?
Over your shoulder.

477
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Gas 66.
There are boxes of canned food, you need to unload it.

478
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,290
We need an empty truck by evening, urgently.

479
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,460
Alright, I'll do it.

480
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Well, why are you just staring, the Gas is over there.

481
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,210
Thanks.

482
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,150
No problem.

483
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
Fyodor Ivanovich.
Fyodor Ivanovich.

484
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,730
Yes.

485
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,390
Yes, I'm here.

486
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,570
Are you the new Pikul?

487
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,260
Are you Marques?
I meant to say, are you the new Marques?

488
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,640
Come on.

489
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,500
Marques.

490
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,490
Now I...

491
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,740
Now, my favorite part.

492
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,130
If love could be measured with a thermometer,

493
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,000
their apartment would have long been covered
with a thin silver shawl of frost.

494
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,720
You... You
feel loneliness so accurately. You...

495
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:53,000
You... You feel loneliness so well.

496
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,890
I can't, I'm gonna cry.

497
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,960
Oh no, don't cry, don't cry.

498
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,500
Don't cry, I mean...
You don't need to cry,

499
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,020
and I don't want you to cry either.

500
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,360
Please, don't cry.

501
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,080
Fyodor Ivanovich, may I

502
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,000
kiss you?

503
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,490
Not as a man, as a genius.

504
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,000
Sure.
Why not?

505
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
On the cheek, on the cheek, is that okay?

506
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,970
Yes, just...

507
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,200
don't call me a genius.
I'm just an ordinary writer.

508
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,150
Fyodor Ivanovich, your novel...

509
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,230
The world must see it.

510
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,430
Really?

511
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,130
No, the front struts are bent,
consider it done for.

512
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It'd be easier to get a new one from Germany.

513
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,530
And ten thousand bucks?
Let the suckers take the bait.

514
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Well, by their standards, it's a screw-up.

515
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:15,270
They can claim it.
Let them try.

516
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,880
If they come after me, well'll fuck them like we did a year ago.

517
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,590
And what if they go after my guys?

518
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,630
I'll send a couple of fighters with RPGs, and that's it.

519
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,530
The Zurabs will go back to the mountains with their pockets full.

520
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,600
No, we don't need that war right now.

521
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,000
War, commander, never ends.

522
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,690
Once we bend, they'll keep fucking us for life.

523
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,030
That's it, Uncle Alik,
I've done everything.

524
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
I unloaded the truck.

525
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,000
I don't get it.
Which truck?

526
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,990
And where?

527
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,740
I took it to the warehouse.
Good job! Bring it back.

528
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,040
How come?
Sancho,

529
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,460
we just loaded it to take to the nursing home.

530
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,020
Hold on! Where are you going, stop. I'll get you home

531
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:39,390
Hey, who's gonna load the food back?

532
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah, damn belt buckle.

533
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,220
Alik, let's go to three wins.

534
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,350
Commander.

535
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:22,000
Just don't pinch my nipples.

536
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
(music plays)

537
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,990
Thanks, Uncle Alik.

538
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,600
Sancho!

539
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:07,380
Turbulent times are starting.

540
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,980
Here, you'll be defending the family.

541
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:13,000
Seriously?

542
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,420
No robbing stalls, don't dig your nose with a gun.

543
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,010
(male voice): So, I tell him:

544
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,460
"Hey, you got the wrong guy?"

545
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,530
Well, our guys showed up then. (female laugh)

546
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,220
Oh, Fedya's here.

547
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,930
Here, husband.

548
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,970
Fedya, meet Vitalik.

549
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Hello.

550
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Nadyukha says you're going in for Raika tomorrow?

551
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,000
Rest in peace.

552
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,040
By the way, I congratulate you on your anniversary.

553
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,300
You really got lucky with your wife.

554
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,200
Nadyukha, well, I’m off.

555
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,630
I won’t make it for the night. Well, go ahead.

556
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,710
Well, go, husband.

557
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,760
Your cardigan is

558
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:32,970
a bomb.

559
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,250
Exactly like this, they buried Raika.

560
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,470
Nadyukha, be careful with your things.

561
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:44,470
See you tomorrow.

562
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,710
Nadyu. What’s up?

563
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,300
Who's this character? This is our boss.

564
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:55,550
Well, really, you'll get used to it.

565
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,660
Mom, Dad.

566
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,680
I didn’t give you the gift yesterday.

567
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,010
Yeah. This is for you.

568
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,260
Thank you.

569
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,300
Sorry, Mom.

570
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,390
Okay.

571
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:57,000
Let's go have some tea.

572
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,870
Hi. Hi.

573
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,480
Looks nice, huh? Yeah.

574
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Well, sit down, what are you standing for?

575
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Listen, sorry I left you. It's just...

576
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:37,040
If Dad had found out, he would have torn my legs off.

577
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,100
It’s okay, I would’ve left you too if I hadn’t lost consciousness.

578
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:49,380
Want some beer? But I’ve never drunk.

579
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Me neither, so what?

580
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,340
Huh?

581
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,330
It probably tastes good.

582
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,880
Yeah.

583
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,260
Can I ask you something? Yeah.

584
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,650
Yesterday, when I was sunbathing, did you stare at me for a long time?

585
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,390
No, we didn’t stare.

586
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:35,810
Yeah.

587
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,200
Thank you. You're welcome.

588
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,110
Oh, what’s this? You’re drinking without us, huh?

589
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Ugh, what kind of crap is this?

590
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Expired or something? How does my dad even drink this, here.

591
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,990
Anyway, you won’t believe it,

592
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:15,000
we were saving a dead cat yesterday. And then we were with this idiot on the go

593
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,380
on the train - wow!

594
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,000
What about you guys? What do you have?

595
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,250
The car was stolen!

596
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,380
(music plays)
